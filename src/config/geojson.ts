        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The Saba Synagogue&mdash;known as Slat Saba&mdash;is a premier example of the small synagogues that dotted the Jewish quarter or mellah of Fez up until the mid 20th century. This site features rare photos and video of the synagogue being used in the early 1900s and 1950s, but also of a visit by Diarna staff to the site in 2007. Today, Slat Saba is a private home.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Stylings:</strong> Although today it is a private home, the 400-year-old building retains many of the characteristics of its original purpose, especially the Torah arks (now used as closets). The intricate tiling, wood carving decorations and paint colors remain remarkably vivid and well preserved.</p><p><strong>Layout:</strong> The main sanctuary is divided into six sections by grand columns, with a skylight three stories above allowing in natural light. Set back and above the main sanctuary was once an alcove for the tevah (prayer stand), directly opposite the wooden Torah arks, which can be seen as panels along the far wall. This alcove was accessed from a separate entrance and looked out over the sanctuary. Today, however, it has been closed to divide the rooms, and the steps leading up to the ark have been removed. The original green and white tile floors remain, and a small women\'s section can be seen behind wooden lattice work on the side high above the main floor.</p><p>Listen to Rabbi Meir Israel read from Megillat Esther (the Scroll of Esther) in Slat Saba on Purim.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/C2TxJIeAXac" width="425" height="350"></iframe></p><p><strong>Key:</strong> In the video below, Fez-native Mukhluf Mamman speaks in Arabic about his memories of the Saba Synagogue in the mellah of Fez, located off La Grande Rue de Mellah to the north on Derb Saba (the western side of the street). He recalls that his grandfather, Mordechai Attia, who lived nearby, was the main guardian of this private synagogue. Early every morning, he would open the synagogue\'s front-door, using an old key with a heavy round ball keychain. It is said that when Mr. Attia died, the imprint of the keychain ball was indelibly molded into the palm of his hand.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vj1v2ABfoJs" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Slat Saba in Fez - Memories of Mukhluf Mamman</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Visiting the site today requires appealing to the owner of the house.

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Casablanca was the Moroccan headquarters of the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle, leading to a number of AIU schools which were established throughout the city. The first AIU school in Casablanca opened in 1897, and by 1951 over 7,000 students--both boys and girls--attended AIU schools. The school is named after one of the Alliance\'s founders and presidents (from 1898-1915), Narcisse Leven. Still open today, the &Eacute;cole Narcisse Leven serves elementary school students in Casablanca.<sup>1</sup></p></p>            <p><p><em>More information regarding Casablanca specifically located after the AIU History.</em></p><p><strong>Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle (AIU) History: </strong>The Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle (AIU) was a Jewish philanthropic organization founded in 1860 by six Jewish intellectuals in Paris, including Adolphe Cr&eacute;mieux, a French Jewish statesman. The Alliance established a network of schools throughout the Middle East, North Africa, Asia Minor, and the Balkans, with the goal to protect and improve the lives of Jews around the world. The organization promotes the values of Jewish self-defense and self-sufficiency through education and professional development. AIU&rsquo;s mission was constructed upon two pillars &mdash; &ldquo;the Jewish tradition and the values ​​of the French school&rdquo;<sup>2</sup> &mdash; which informed their aim of aiding Jewish emancipation, enfranchisement, protection of rights, and modernization, in order to facilitate their integration into their home countries.<sup>3</sup> However, it was at times the case that, instead of being integrated, they became detached, with some Alliance students feeling disconnected from their non-Alliance Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as the French and European world. The Alliance established schools for both boys and girls, with the first school being constructed in 1862 in Tetouan, Morocco. By 1895, there were seventy schools with 17,000 students enrolled.<sup>4</sup> Aside from the primary school system, the Alliance also established vocational schools, agricultural schools, apprenticeship programs, rabbinical seminaries, and teaching schools where they would train the next generation of Alliance teachers and directors. At AIU&rsquo;s peak in 1913, there were 183 active schools with 43,700 students.<sup>5</sup> The Alliance created an entire generation of educated Jews who were able to enter the workforce and experience upward social mobility, many of whom had previously not received a formal education, especially girls and young women. In the middle of the 20th century, with the mass exodus of Jews from their home countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Alliance schools began to close their doors. The organization, however, is still active. Known as &ldquo;Alliance - Kol Israel Haverim&rdquo; in Israel, it &ldquo;works towards two main goals: 1) Advance educational excellence for all children regardless of socio-economic status or geographic location that in turn will lead to increased social mobility. 2) Offer a Jewish education that emphasizes social responsibility and involvement, while cultivating Jewish leadership committed to social activists."<sup>6</sup></p><p><strong>Casablanca History:</strong> During the early twentieth century, Casablanca became Morocco&rsquo;s primary seaport. This caused Casablanca to grow and flourish, bringing many new inhabitants to the city, with many of them being Jews; Casablanca&rsquo;s Jewish community was the largest out of the Maghreb during the twentieth century. While a Jewish community can be traced back to as early as the fifteenth century, it was not until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when an organized community was developed. Based on census figures, 20,000 Jews resided in Casablanca in 1926, 40,000 in 1936, and 74,000 in 1952. Before the protectorate period, Jews lived in the mellah (an established Jewish quarter, named after the salt marsh area in Fez where the first mellah was created<sup>7</sup>), but after the protectorate they were no longer required to live within the mellah. In 1949, Casablanca became the headquarters of Cadima, the \'aliya organization in Morocco designed to organize emigration to Israel. Between 1949 and 1956, when Cadima ended, Moroccan Jews passed through Casablanca on their paths to Israel. The number of Jews living in Casablanca declined through the 1960s and 70s, yet the community grew in importance on a national scale; it still remained the Jewish center of Morocco and largest Jewish population in the Arab world. In 2010, Casablanca\'s Jewish population numbered around fewer than 3,000 inhabitants.<sup>8</sup></p><p><strong>AIU in Casablanca:</strong> The AIU&rsquo;s Moroccan headquarters were located in Casablanca. Many schools were established all throughout Casablanca, with the first one being created in 1897 by Moise Nahon.<sup>9</sup> This came to be after French vice-consul, M. Craveri, appealed to the AIU Central Committee, explaining that Casablanca would eventually become an important port, and that France should be the ones to bring over modern education to the Casablancan population.<sup>10</sup> Over time, many of the children obtained an AIU education. In 1901, there were 295 boys and 161 girls enrolled in the AIU.<sup>11</sup> By 1912 there were a total of 557 pupils, 331 boys and 198 girls.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Director Nahon realized in 1906 that only thirty-four of the children enrolled at the AIU had Casablancan parents, the other pupils were migrants from other Moroccan cities, with seventy-five coming from the north, twenty-six from Marrakesh, forty-four from the interior, twenty-three from the Atlas, and eighteen from unspecified locations.<sup>13</sup> Casablanca was also a location for the training of AIU teachers, it was called &Eacute;cole Normale Hebraique (ENH) and it was created in 1946. In 1951, there were 7,683 students, boys and girls, of the AIU. The &Eacute;cole Narcisse Leven school still operates as an elementary school for children in Casablanca.<sup>14</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Andre Levy; Daniel Schroeter, "Casablanca," in <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>, ed.

It is currently the capital of Morocco, and has a twin city by the name of Sal&eacute;, which is on the northern bank of the same river. Rabat&rsquo;s Jewish community can be traced back to before the arrival of Islam, but recieved fewer Jews then other Moroccan cities during the time when Jews were fleeing persecution in Spain, Portugal, and elsewhere. Jews migrated from other Moroccan cities, mostly settling in the Behira quarter of Rabat. Piracy and trade flourished in both Rabat and Sal&eacute; during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with Jews mainly taking part in the import of weapons with the help of their coreligionists in the Netherlands. Jews also held prominent positions as ambassadors, navigating the trade and finances between Morocco and European powers. The importance of these two cities decreased with the events of an earthquake in 1755, a famine in 1799, and the establishment of a rival Moroccan port named Essaouira in 1764. Rabat slowly gained prominence when it was declared the capital of Morocco in 1912. The Jewish population steadily increased, with there being around 2,000-2,400 in 1912, 4,200 in 1931, 6,000 in 1939, and reached a height of 12,000 in 1947.<sup>9</sup> Currently, Rabat continues to support a Jewish community of fewer than 400, while Sal&eacute; has none. Although the community is small--consisting mainly of retirees, businesspeople, and some professionals--it maintains one synagogue in the <em>ville nouvelle,&nbsp;</em>a "shohet" (kosher butcher), and a kosher restaurant.<sup>10</sup></p><p><strong>AIU in Rabat:</strong> In 1905, the AIU established a school for boys in Rabat. By 1913, they had an enrollment of 235 pupils. A subsequent AIU school was established in Sal&eacute; in 1913. A man by the name of Joseph Conquy was the director of the school in Rabat, and was also the community&rsquo;s doctor. He aided the sick and implemented immunization programs, especially during the typhus epidemic.<sup>11</sup> In 1903, Rabat was attacked by the Zair Arab tribe, resulting in damage to the mellah walls (an established Jewish quarter, named after the salt marsh area in Fez where the first mellah was created<sup>12</sup>). Conquy went to the Spanish consul and succeeded in getting their support for repairing the walls. Due to Rabat being a center for migration, many of its pupils were migrants from other Moroccan cities.<sup>13</sup> In 1936, Rabat\'s AIU school had an attendance of 1,030 Jewish children, and in 1951 there was 1,392.<sup>14</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Jessica Marglin, "Rabat-Sal&eacute;," in <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>, ed. by Norman A.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The southern Moroccan city of Taroudant once was home to two Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle (AIU) schools. The below video is of a visit to the original AIU campus that opened in 1929 and is situated just outside the Jewish cemetery on the southwestern flank of the walled city. A larger campus was built decades later in a different area. Both school buildings are used today as public schools, since the Alliance ceased operating them in 1963 following the near complete dissolution of the city&rsquo;s Jewish community.<sup>1</sup></p></p>            <p><p><em>More information regarding Taroudant specifically located after the AIU History.</em></p><p><strong>Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle (AIU) History: </strong>The Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle (AIU) was a Jewish philanthropic organization founded in 1860 by six Jewish intellectuals in Paris, including Adolphe Cr&eacute;mieux, a French Jewish statesman. The Alliance established a network of schools throughout the Middle East, North Africa, Asia Minor, and the Balkans, with the goal to protect and improve the lives of Jews around the world. The organization promotes the values of Jewish self-defense and self-sufficiency through education and professional development. AIU&rsquo;s mission was constructed upon two pillars &mdash; &ldquo;the Jewish tradition and the values ​​of the French school&rdquo;<sup>2</sup> &mdash; which informed their aim of aiding Jewish emancipation, enfranchisement, protection of rights, and modernization, in order to facilitate their integration into their home countries.<sup>3</sup> However, it was at times the case that, instead of being integrated, they became detached, with some Alliance students feeling disconnected from their non-Alliance Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as the French and European world. The Alliance established schools for both boys and girls, with the first school being constructed in 1862 in Tetouan, Morocco. By 1895, there were seventy schools with 17,000 students enrolled.<sup>4</sup> Aside from the primary school system, the Alliance also established vocational schools, agricultural schools, apprenticeship programs, rabbinical seminaries, and teaching schools where they would train the next generation of Alliance teachers and directors. At AIU&rsquo;s peak in 1913, there were 183 active schools with 43,700 students.<sup>5</sup> The Alliance created an entire generation of educated Jews who were able to enter the workforce and experience upward social mobility, many of whom had previously not received a formal education, especially girls and young women. In the middle of the 20th century, with the mass exodus of Jews from their home countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Alliance schools began to close their doors. The organization, however, is still active. Known as &ldquo;Alliance - Kol Israel Haverim&rdquo; in Israel, it &ldquo;works towards two main goals: 1) Advance educational excellence for all children regardless of socio-economic status or geographic location that in turn will lead to increased social mobility. 2) Offer a Jewish education that emphasizes social responsibility and involvement, while cultivating Jewish leadership committed to social activists."<sup>6</sup></p><p><strong>Taroudant History: </strong>The exact date of the emergence of the Jewish community in Taroudant (also Tarudant) is unclear, but it may have existed as early as the eleventh century. Located at a crossroads, Taroudant\'s history and economy was influenced by the sugar industry and trans-Saharan trade. Taroudant&rsquo;s Jewish community numbered approximately one thousand, with its nearby smaller communities having populations between thirty and two hundred. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Taroudant was acclaimed for its Kabbala, as well as the dynasty of the Cohen Azugh family, who were venerated kabbalists.<sup>7</sup></p><p><strong>AIU in Taroudant:</strong> The Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle opened an elementary school in Taroudant, Morocco in 1929, with hundreds of children attending for the decades to come. With the younger generation eventually moving to secondary schools in major cities such as Casablanca, families moving out of Taroudant in the hopes of obtaining better economic opportunities, and the growing migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel, the majority of the Jewish community in Taroudant left, causing the AIU to close in 1962.<sup>8</sup></p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/08W-IPfV3XE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Alliance Israelite School in Taroudant, Morocco&nbsp;</strong></em></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Yossef Chetrit, "Tarudant," in <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>, ed.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle (AIU) did not reach Akka (Aqqā), located in Morocco\'s bled siba, the rugged land beyond government in the Amazigh (Berber) south, until 1952. A single, co-educational school was opened, and by 1956 reportedly had 26 students, eight of whom were girls. The school closed a decade later in 1962, due to the mass exodus of Jews leaving Morocco. The exact location of this school is unknown.</p></p>            <p><p><em>More information regarding Akka specifically located after the AIU History.</em></p><p><strong>Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle (AIU) History:</strong> The Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle (AIU) was a Jewish philanthropic organization founded in 1860 by six Jewish intellectuals in Paris, including Adolphe Cr&eacute;mieux, a French Jewish statesman.

Ifrān) left in 1792 due to persecution. It was home to four mellahs (an established Jewish quarter, named after the salt marsh area in Fez where the first mellah was created<sup>6</sup>), with the main settlements being located in Irahalan, Tagadirt, Taourirt (Tawrirt), and Agadir Ouzrou (Agādīr Uzrū).<sup>7</sup> Gradually growing, one could see more than 200 Jewish quarters in the region in the mid-twentieth century. The Jewish community was vital to Akka (Aqqā)&rsquo;s economic flourishment, through peddling and forming strong relations with the Muslim community, with a common saying being "a market without Jews is like bread without salt."<sup>8</sup> The Jews&rsquo; dhimmi status (protected peoples) allowed them to be protected by the governors and be able to maintain their positions.</p><p><strong>AIU in Akka (Aqqā):</strong> While the implementation of the Alliance schools began in the mid-nineteenth century, not every city felt the AIU&rsquo;s reach as early. In the 1940s and 1950s, the AIU created schools in the remote villages of Morocco.<sup>9</sup> &nbsp;One of the late bloomers was the city of Akka (Aqqā), which had an AIU school established in 1952. Akka (Aqqā) is located in southwest Morocco, in what is known as the bled siba, described as the areas outside governmental control. Two reasons for the late introduction of the AIU to Akka (Aqqā) is that one, the French colonial authorities only gained control over the area in the 1930s, as well as the fact AIU graduates with their roots in the bled put forward a concerted effort to expand the AIU southward.<sup>10</sup> After the growth of the AIU, Jewish children began to attend the AIU instead of the synagogues and other French primary schools like they did prior. This acceptance was due to their need to combat the political and economic crises that came during the wake of World War II. A difference between the AIU schools in the urban cities of Morocco versus in the bled was that the bled schools were mixed, instead of them being segregated by boys and girls. In 1956, Akka (Aqqā)&rsquo;s Alliance school has twenty-six students, seventeen being boys and eight being girls.<sup>11</sup></p><p><strong>Closure and Emigration: </strong>Akka (Aqqā)&rsquo;s AIU school closed its doors in 1962, which was brought on by the mass migration of Akka (Aqqā)&rsquo;s Jewish community, and Morocco&rsquo;s in general, to Israel and Europe. Almost all of the Jews of Akka (Aqqā) migrated to Israel in 1962.<sup>12</sup> More than 90,000 Moroccan Jews migrated between 1948-1956.<sup>13</sup> The population of Jews in Morocco in 1948 was 265,000, but the population of Jews in Morocco in 2019 was 2,100.<sup>14</sup> Today, Akka\'s synagogue in Tagadirt has fallen into disrepair, yet the three Jewish cemeteries have been protected by Akka\'s Muslim community.<sup>15</sup> Today, Morocco is one of the safest countries for Jews in the Arab world, and a close ally to Israel.<sup>16</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1]&nbsp;"Les &eacute;coles De L\'Alliance | AIU."

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b>  No summary has been provided. </p>            <p><p><strong>AIU School: </strong>The Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle School in Tangier, Morocco, was founded in 1864.<sup>1</sup> A girls&rsquo; school was later founded in 1883. The AIU organization, which formed in 1860 in Paris, France, aimed to unite, protect, and educate Jews all across the world.<sup>2</sup> The school provided a free French-style education to many Jews who were uneducated and impoverished living in the Middle East and North Africa.<sup>3</sup> The school was subsidized by Jewish investors. For example, the boys&rsquo; school in Tangier received around 9,800 francs while the girls&rsquo; school received around 1,200. Initially the Jewish community welcomed the Alliance organization, as they hoped the school would counterbalance the emerging mission schools operated by the Franciscan Brothers.<sup>4</sup> However, the secular nature of the curriculum was met with disapproval by some of the Jewish community leaders. They were worried that a secular school would corrupt their proud Jewish and tried to convert the school to become a rabbinic teaching center.<sup>5</sup></p><p>In the 1880&rsquo;s, tensions arose between the AIU director, Mo&iuml;se Fresco, and the community council, due to the former&rsquo;s refusal to amend the teaching curriculum. The council, the junta, was displeased that the school was emphasizing secular rather than religious education. For example, leaders were angered to discover that the children at the AIU learned that rain was not sent by God, but created from water vapor.<sup>6</sup> By 1887, tensions reached such a height, that Fresco decided to rent a new building for the AIU school and detach it from the Talmud Torah School next to it.<sup>7</sup> The junta campaigned furiously against the AIU schools, pressuring parents to withdraw their students. On March 17, 1887, only five pupils were left in the school from the 200 pupils that were learning in the beginning of March.<sup>8</sup> The Paris administration, assessing the situation, closed down the boys&rsquo; school to reopen it seven months later in November of 1887 under a new director. Ironically, the school reopened with no changes in curriculum as the junta allowed for all of the conditions set by the AIU for the new school. The girls&rsquo; school was not affected by these events, as girls&rsquo; religious education was not as valued as the boys&rsquo;.<sup>9</sup> In 1899, both schools had around 600 pupils attending classes and around half of those students were non-Jews; Christians, Muslims, and other members of the communities were admitted to the school.<sup>10</sup> Teachers at the school were just as diverse as the students.<sup>11</sup> Students received textbooks, lunch, and sometimes even clothing from the AIU organization. Sometimes the school hosted literacy programs for adults who were unable to receive a proper education in their youth.<sup>12</sup> By this time, the qualms between the AIU leadership and the junta had filtered out and the Jewish community was witnessing AIU graduates move on to successful futures.<sup>13</sup></p><p>In 1939, the total number of students attending AIU Moroccan schools reached approximately 16,000, and by 1952, the number reached around 28,000. However, as the situation in Morocco worsened, especially after the Israel-Arab War in 1947-8, many Jews left Morocco, and schools had to close down. By 1963, the student attendance dropped to 14,000, almost a 50% decrease in ten years. In 1960, the AIU schools came under the control of the Moroccan Education Department, transitioning from a private organization to part of the French public school system in Morocco. The schools were renamed the Ittihad-Maroc schools, losing their Jewish attributes.<sup>14</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Michael M.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b>  No summary has been provided. </p>            <p><p><strong>Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universale/Universelle (AIU) History:</strong> The Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universale/Universelle (AIU) was an educational network founded by emancipated French Jews in Paris, France in the year 1860.<sup>1</sup> This organization was founded as a reflection of the belief that, &ldquo;All Jews are responsible for each other&rdquo; and that modern education was key to the health and well-being of Jews in the Middle East and North Africa.<sup>2</sup> As such, it was the first body of its kind, and a major source of education, identity, and security for Jews throughout the Middle East and North Africa. The AIU opened its first school in Tetouan, Morocco in 1862, followed shortly by a school in Tangiers in 1869.<sup>3</sup></p><p>The AIU was greatly appreciated and quite effective as an organization undoubtedly dedicated to the advancement of Jewish peoples around the world. That being said, the AIU is not without its tensions and contradictions. For one, as an effort to change "Oriental" Jewish lives moving from France to the Middle East and North Africa, the AIU was not divorced from its imperial context and its own &ldquo;civilizing mission.&rdquo; France was a major colonial power with many holdings in North Africa. Morocco, for example, was made a French protectorate in 1912. The AIU&rsquo;s impetus in France, as well as its teaching of French as the primary language of instruction (Hebrew and Arabic as secondary and tertiary, if at all), and its vision of &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo; Jews needing of both moral and intellectual education, are all markers of what some critique as a, "colonial gaze."<sup>4</sup> It is important, however, to remain cognizant of the overall context of the AIU\'s mission--a mission to defend and uplift Jews around the world. In many Arab lands, Jews--recognized as holding &nbsp;\'dhimmi\' (protected) status--were not equal citizens. This status prevented their holding certain jobs, expressing their religion openly, and being represented under the law. Many Jews, therefore, had to resort to "immoral" professions to make ends meet, such as money-lending and even prostitution. Some claim there was a distinct paradigm between Jews and Arabs in Arab lands--one which left the Jews destitute. However, it is far too over-simplifying to suggest a consistent paradigm of relationships across time and space in Arab lands<sup>5</sup> (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-24863-6_8). Regardless of the severity of dhimmi differentiation, Jews of Arab lands did benefit from an organization purely designed to uplift the "oriental" Jew.&nbsp;</p><p>In its structure, the secular nature of the AIU\'s teachings came into conflict with many of the more traditionally religious aspects of local Jewish communities in places like Morocco.<sup>6</sup> That being said, local officials in Morocco as well as alumni of the AIU in Tangier, &ldquo;Tangier&rsquo;s new elite&rdquo;<sup>7</sup> worked very hard to further the influence of the AIU in their communities. They saw the education of the AIU not as a &ldquo;europeanization,&rdquo; but as a &ldquo;modernization&rdquo; that they embraced and valued.<sup>8</sup> Ultimately, the influence of the AIU in Morocco was notable, mobilizing Jews either to resist its colonial elements or embrace its provision of quality education and global Jewish camaraderie.</p><p><strong>The AIU Network and Morocco:&nbsp;</strong>The AIU network expanded quickly, with 100 schools and approximately 26,000 students by 1900<sup>9</sup> and 43,700 students in 183 AIU schools by 1914.<sup>10</sup> The institutions were set up mostly in North Africa and the Middle East, stretching from Morocco to Iran.</p><p>The AIU schools in Tangiers (founded in 1869) were responsible for educating nearly 5,500 students in 14 schools by 1912.<sup>11</sup> In the inter-war period, however, the AIU lost momentum and handed many schools over to local educational bodies. The local authorities, strongly supporting AIU institutions in Morocco, enabled the AIU to continue expansion post-WWII. In fact, by 1952 there were approximately 28,000 AIU students in Morocco, primarily in large urban areas.<sup>12</sup> In total, there were 6 AIU schools in Tangiers and Spanish Morocco,<sup>13</sup> but it is difficult to say if any of the schools exist today.</p><p>One important aspect of the AIU\'s mission in Morocco was to combat what were seen as "backwards" gendered institutions, such as child marriage.<sup>14</sup> Beverly Mizrachi discusses the effects of the AIU education on women and young girls in Morocco specifically. She explains that with the education of the AIU, and with curriculum that was often the same in boys\' schools and in girls,\' young Jewish Moroccan girls were given a unique opportunity to become more educated and more financially independent than ever before.<sup>15</sup></p><p><strong>Jews of Tangiers:</strong> There were Jews living in Tangiers for centuries before they were, "wiped out by the Almohades in 1148."<sup>16</sup> Later, with the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, Sephardim brought Jewish vibrancy back to Tangiers.<sup>17</sup> In the 1920s, there were approximately 10,000 Jews living in Tangiers. However today, there are approximately 150.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Aaron Rodrigue,&nbsp;<em>Jews and Muslims: Images of Sephardi and Eastern Jewries in Modern Times, </em>(University of Washington Press, 2003)&nbsp;7.</p><p>[2] Rodrigue, <em>Jews and Muslims: Images of Sephardi and Eastern Jewries in Modern Times</em>,&nbsp; 8.</p><p>[3] "Jewish/Israel Organizations:&nbsp;Alliance Israelite Universelle,"&nbsp;Jewish Virtual Library, accessed July 6, 2016, <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html</a>.</p><p>[4] Rodrigue, <em>Jews and Muslims: Images of Sephardi and Eastern Jewries in Modern Times.</em></p><p>[5]&nbsp;Moshe Shokeid, "&nbsp;Jewish Existence in a Berber Environment,"&nbsp;<em>Jews Among Muslims in Precolonial Times, </em>(Palgrave Macmillan, 1996).&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p>[6] Michael Laskier,&nbsp;<em>The Alliance Israelite Universelle and the Jewish Communities of Morocco: 1862-1962</em>, (State University of New York Press, 1983).</p><p>[7] Jessica Marglin, "Modernizing Moroccan Jews: The AIU Alumni Association in Tangier, 1893&mdash;1913," The Jewish Quarterly Review, 101 (2011): 575.</p><p>[8] Marglin, "Modernizing Moroccan Jews: The AIU Alumni Association in Tangier, 1893&mdash;1913."</p><p>[9]&nbsp;Mark Tessler, <em>A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</em>, (Indiana University Press, 1994) 29.</p><p>[10] Rodrigue, <em>Jews and Muslims: Images of Sephardi and Eastern Jewries in Modern Times</em>, 14.</p><p>[11] "Jewish/Israel Organizations:&nbsp;Alliance Israelite Universelle,"&nbsp;Jewish Virtual Library, accessed July 6, 2016, <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html</a>.</p><p>[12]&nbsp;"Jewish/Israel Organizations: Alliance Israelite Universelle," Jewish Virtual Library, accessed July 6, 2016, <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html</a>.</p><p>[13] Laskier, <em>The Alliance Israelite Universelle and the Jewish Communities of Morocco: 1862-1962.</em></p><p>[14] Laskier, <em>The Alliance Israelite Universelle and the Jewish Communities of Morocco: 1862-1962.</em></p><p>[15] Beverly Mizrachi,&nbsp;&ldquo;Morocco: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries,&rdquo; Jewish Women\'s Archive, accessed on July 7, 2016,&nbsp;<a href="http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/morocco-nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries">http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/morocco-nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries</a>.</p><p>[16] "Virtual Jewish World:&nbsp;Tangier, Morocco,"&nbsp;Jewish Virtual Library, accessed July 7, 2016,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html</a></p><p>[17]&nbsp;"Virtual Jewish World: Tangier, Morocco," Jewish Virtual Library, accessed July 7, 2016, <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html</a></p><p>[18] "Virtual Jewish World: Tangier, Morocco," Jewish Virtual Library, accessed July 7, 2016, http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Tangier.html</p></p>            <p><font color="#999999">© Digital Heritage Mapping, Inc.</font></p>',

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p><strong>Rabbi Avraham Toledano Synagogue: </strong>The Rabbi Abraham Toledano Synagogue was built in the 19th century. It is named after Abraham Toledano, a leading member of the Tangier Jewish Community who helped the community establish its own legal independence from its neighboring Jewish villages.<sup>1</sup> It is the oldest and smallest synagogue in the &ldquo;synagogue cluster&rdquo; located in the corner of the Tangier medina, the center of the city. Other synagogues in the area are the Rabbi Messoud Synagogue, the Rabbi Yahiya Syangogue, the Rabbi Akiva Laredo Synagogue, and the Rabbi Mordechai Bengio Synagogue.<sup>2</sup> Sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;Ha-Knesset ha-Gadolah&rdquo; (The Great Synagogue), the building is decorated with lamps, silver ornaments, and beautiful woodwork.<sup>3</sup> As there are barely any Jews left in Morocco today, the synagogue is no longer in use.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Toledano Family: </strong>The name Toledano comes from the family&rsquo;s original home: Toledo, Spain. After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, the Toledano family made their way to North Africa, settling in Safed, Salonika, and Morocco.<sup>4</sup> The family initially settled in Meknes, Morocco, in the 16th century and quickly began establishing connections with the local Sultan and building a merchant business. Some of the local Jews were angry at the extremely wealthy Toledano family due to its position as the community&rsquo;s leader.<sup>5</sup> The Toledano&rsquo;s were not only merchants but also famous rabbis and scholars. Daniel (I) ben Joseph Toledano (ca. 1570&ndash;1640) established himself as the head of the Castilinian scholars in Fez, Morocco. His sons also became important leaders and rabbis. Hayyim ben Habib he-Hasid (d. ca. 1680) was a dayyan, a religious judge for a bet din (Jewish court), and head of the Meknes yeshiva, a Jewish university. In Tangier, Morocco, Aaron Toledano (1705 - 1785) was also a dayyan. His son, Abraham (1792 - 1833), set up Tangier&rsquo;s first permanent bet din, which was an important step in recognizing the town&rsquo;s independence from its surrounding Jewish communities. The Rabbi Abraham Toledano synagogue was named after him. In the 19th century many Toledano&rsquo;s began writing scholarly works on religious texts, like Habib ben Eliezer (ca. 1800-1870), whose work was a response on critics of the Torah, and an analysis on the distinction between the philosophical and legal work of Maimonides.<sup>6</sup> In the middle of the 20th century, with the establishment of the state of Israel, the family made Aliyah, the immigration of Jews to Israel, and left Morocco.<sup>7</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Shalom Bar-Asher, "Toledano Family (Moroccan Branch)," In <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World,</em> ed.

The walls and ceiling are covered with intricate carvings, illuminated by hanging lamps.&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>History:</strong>&nbsp;The synagogues of Tangier are located in the city\'s mellah, mostly on the appropriately-named Synagogues Street--which was recently renamed Synagogue Street, as the Moshe Nahon Synagogue is the only one that remains open.<sup>2 </sup>The synagogue was built by Moshe Nahon, a banker and active member of the Tangier Jewish community, in 1878.<sup>3</sup> Although it fell into disrepair in the late twentieth century, a Jewish architect renovated it in 1994 and today it is one of the few open synagogues in Tangier.<sup>4</sup> The synagogue has a separate entrance for women, as well as an upper gallery. The walls follow a Spanish tradition in ornamentation, covered with calligraphy and floral designs in the Mujedar style.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tangier:</strong>&nbsp;The Jewish presence in Tangier was limited until the late 17th century, when the Muslims regained control of the city from the English.

In that time, the Jewish community had established schools, hospitals, and other charitable works, as well as participating in civic groups such as the Comission of Hygiene.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;In 1925, Jews were assigned three of the twenty-six seats on the International Legislative Assembly, Tangier\'s governing body, giving them a certain amount of formal political power.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The aftermath of World War II proved to be a golden age for Tangier\'s Jews, many of whom lived prosperous and cosmopolitan lives, but Moroccan independence in 1956 led to slow but steady emigration. As of 2007, less than one hundred Jews remain in Tangier.<sup>9</sup></p><p><strong>Eyewitness Description:</strong> A description of the Moshe Nahon Synagogue in 1999, five years after renovation: "A small, unobtrusive door opens on to a narrow alleyway that in no way hints at the monumental size of the synagogue itself. Like most synagogues in Tangier, it is rectangular, and divided by pillars into three naves. A wall painting of the tablets of the law and a crown appear above the ark on the eastern wall, similar to Ketubot (marriage contracts) in synagogues in Gibraltar. A large sculpted wooden lectern is placed near the eastern side. The only exception to the Tangier model is the Nahon synagogue where the tevah(lectern for Torah reading) is placed in the centre of the southern wall. The walls are painted sky blue or yellow and verses from the Bible mentioning the name of the donor of the synagogue are inscribed on them."<sup>10</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Kessir, Athmane.

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Bou Arfa, a town far south along the railway from Tendrara, was home to the largest Vichy-era labor camp in Morocco, located near the main train station. According to the Red Cross, 818 people were interned there as of&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WPj_N7O3md8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 1942</a>. As such, Bou Arfa&rsquo;s camp had three satellite camps, one of which was Ain el-Ourak, located near an old mine south of Bou Arfa. According to historian Robert Satloff, Ain el-Ourak &ldquo;served until May 1942 as the main discipline site for Bou Arfa laborers. When French officers sold the site to a local Arab notable for 100,000 francs, they moved the camp to a place called&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WPj_N7O3md8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foum Deflah</a>.&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Drive south from Tendrara to Bou Arfa. Once you arrive in Bou Arfa, ask for the old mines and mention that they were near the site of a French labor camp. Someone older will know and can give you directions, at least to the mining encampment. Once you reach the encampment, ask again, and someone will tell you to take a dirt road adjacent to the barred-off mine. Follow the dirt road, heading ever closer to the dramatic mountains, passing shepherds and their flocks until you find a small brick dwelling. Get out of the car to ask someone for directions. A man appears shortly, and after exchanging the necessary salaams, this man, perhaps dressed in a worn leather jacket, dust-worn pants and a scarf to protect his head from the sun, tells you to take a certain dirt road which will turn into rocks so sharp you will have to park and walk three kilometers to the foothills of the mountain, which you will recognize by the palm trees in the distance. As promised, at a certain juncture the road becomes too harsh for your car to pass. Park, and began the trek into the bleary, dusty distance. Eventually you spy palm trees from afar. You also see a smattering of low, brick structures, next to a small palm oasis, not a single person in sight.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXVU4l8AvPA" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> &nbsp; &nbsp;<em><strong>Ain el-Ourak Vichy (Holocaust era) Labor Camp in Southern Morocco&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><strong>What is Left:&nbsp;</strong>The camp structures blend into the foot of the mountains until you get closer. For a while, you can only see the palm trees, until slowly they shimmer into your line of sight from dusty obscurity. The structures are quite different from those of Tendrara, a larger camp with imposing ruins further north, and are more conical in design. Next to the conical buildings are square structures with triangular doorways. They are elevated, on a hill, providing a gorgeous panoramic view of the mountains and rocky plateau. There may even be the remnants of a cemetery, but you are not sure.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Robert Satloff. <em>Among the Righteous: Lost Stories from the Holocaust\'s Long Reach into Arab Lands</em> (New York: Public Affairs, 2006), pp. 68-69.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span">The Holocaust&rsquo;s long reach extended even into the Sahara Desert, as the remains of this forced labor camp can attest. In the early 1940s, France&rsquo;s Vichy regime established a series of labor camps in North Africa for Jews and others. Many of the Jews incarcerated were European, including a large group of Polish Jews. After being shipped across the Mediterranean, they were delivered to remote camps via a rail line that runs south through Morocco parallel to the Algerian border.</span></span></p></p>            <p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The camp at Foum Deflah served as a &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; center for certain prisoners from the larger detention camp at Bou Arfa, a town to the northwest. Set in a stark valley on the edge of the Sahara, the solitary camp seems to be in the middle of nowhere. Most prisoners lived in tents and slept on straw mats. Under the direction of an overseer, a certain Lt. Thomas, terrible torture was meted out against prisoners.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gL7ejaWMrhc" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> &nbsp; <em><strong>Foum Deflia</strong></em></p><p><strong>Torture:</strong> The most notorious was &ldquo;the tomb&rdquo; where prisoners were forced to dig a coffin-sized hole in the earth and lie in pseudo graves, sometimes for weeks. Some worked during the day and then returned to their grave beds at night. Others were forced to lie still the entire day, enduring scorching sun by day and freezing cold nights. Fed only bread and water, prisoners who dared move would be beaten. Some tried to escape. Others died in their open graves, amidst the desolate emptiness of the desert landscape.</p><p><strong>How to get there:</strong> The apparent remains of the camp can still be visited via a dirt road off the main route leading to the town of Figuig. Head north along the dry riverbed of the Deflah river, which rarely flows. A few crumbling stone structures are all that is left of this forgotten Holocaust camp.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Satloff, Robert Barry.<em> Among the Righteous: Lost Stories from the Holocaust\'s Long Reach into Arab Lands</em>.

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The small town of Tendrara is the site of a Vichy era labor camp, built along the railroad stretching from Oran, Algeria, south through Morocco&rsquo;s eastern border. The railroad was largely built by the labor of Vichy prisoners, sent to camps like this one. It is the best-preserved Vichy camp along Morocco&rsquo;s eastern border with Algeria, perhaps in the entire country.</p><p>How to get there: Continue south for about sixty miles from the camp at Ain Benimatthar in eastern Morocco. There is no traffic on this stunning but desolate stretch of road, so it should only take you an hour or so. Tendrara is just as deserted and run-down as Ain Benimatthar. Ask around, and someone will point you in the direction of the abandoned Vichy labor camp, a little bit east of town along a dirt road. Once you find the dirt road, follow it for about thirty minutes. You might occasionally encounter donkey-drawn vehicles, but mostly there isn&rsquo;t a soul in sight. You will eventually turn a corner and see imposing tan buildings in the distance, with the shimmer of the telltale train tracks.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>What Remains:</strong> The Tendrara buildings loom empty, the ceilings caved in. It is a complex abandoned to rot, with barbed wire poking out under over-grown grass. The ground is littered with French produced Marseille tiles, some of which are decorated with absurd hearts.&nbsp;The buildings all face the train tracks except for one, silent watchers for trains that passed through long ago on a now abandoned rail project. The staircase to the station house is intact; if you walk in, you will see traces of blue or green paint, a staircase to a basement, fireplaces, shattered glass and broken bricks. Many of the walls have crumbled halfway to the floor, but the subdivisions are still clear.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXE4nygdzDM" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br /><em><strong>Vichy Camp at Tendrara: Holocaust History in North Africa&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Some buildings are larger and grander than others.&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WPj_N7O3md8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=satloff%20righteous&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q=satloff%20righteous&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to historian Robert Satloff:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">"...the buildings were clearly laid out for use either by soldiers or the military-like overseers of the CMO [Chemins de Fer du Maroc Oriental, railroads of eastern Morocco] and Trans-Saharan Railways.

The prisoners who labored there&mdash;Jews from Warsaw, Leipzig, Salzburg, and Bucharest as well as Spaniards and others lived in tents.&rdquo;</p><p>Stepping back, it is an abandoned city in the desert, complete with buildings grand and small.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>City of Sal&eacute; (سلا), in Morocco.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Sal&eacute; History:</strong> Sal&eacute; is the twin port city of Rabat, Morocco&rsquo;s capital since 1912. Sal&eacute; is located on the northern bank of the Bou Regreg River on the Atlantic coast, while Rabat is located on the southern bank of the same river. It is believed that Sal&eacute;&rsquo;s Jewish community can be traced back to before the arrival of Islam. Both Rabat and Sal&eacute; were the only ports to not be captured by Christians. Under the rule of the Marinids, the Wattasids, and the Saʿdis, Sal&eacute; flourished and was recognized as a center of urban civilization. Sal&eacute; received fewer Jewish refugees than other Moroccan cities during the time when Jews were fleeing persecution in Spain, Portugal, and elsewhere. Piracy and trade flourished in both Rabat and Sal&eacute; during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with Jews mainly taking part in the import of weapons with the help of their coreligionists in the Netherlands. Jews also held prominent positions as ambassadors, navigating the trade and finances between Morocco and European powers. Sale was a renowned center, with it being home to many important scholars, the venerated Kabbalist Hayyim Ben Attar, and was a hub for Sabbateanism, a Jewish messianic movement driven by the Sabbatai Zevi. The importance of these two cities decreased with the events of an earthquake in 1755, a famine in 1799, and the establishment of a rival Moroccan port named Essaouira in 1764. The Alliance Israelite Universelle established a school in Sal&eacute; in 1913, with resistance taking place in the beginning of its creation, but once their Chief Rabbi Raphael Anqawa gave his support, resistance diminished and support actually grew, causing the Talmud Torah schools to decline in number.<sup>1</sup> In 1936 there were 502 students enrolled in the AIU in Sal&eacute;, and in 1951 there were 536 students.<sup>2</sup> While Rabat slowly gained prominence when it was declared the capital of Morocco in 1912, Sal&eacute; remained in the shadow of its twin city. In the late eighteenth century Sal&eacute; had around 2,000 Jews, by 1912, their population dropped to 1,500. By 1931, the population grew to approximately 2,300, in 1936 there were 2,600, and in 1951 there were 3,300.<sup>3</sup> During the beginning of the twenty-first century little to no Jews could be found in Sal&eacute;.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Jessica Marglin, "Rabat-Sal&eacute;," in <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>, ed.

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Outside of Teroudant, in the small southern village of Bizou, is the tomb of Rabbi David Ben Barukh HaCohen Azugh, some of whose descendants are still to be found in Morocco. The Azugh family is active in the synagogue that bears his name in Casablanca and is responsible for the upkeep of and hillula (yearly pilgrimage) to his shrine, which occurs on the 8th day of Chanukah.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>David Ben Barukh HaCohen Azugh: </strong>Rabbi David Ben Barukh HaCohen Azugh was a member of a long line of Moroccan Jews regarded as saints, with an ancestry tracing back to the high priests of the First Temple. He is said to have performed many miracles, both during his life and after his death in 1760. He left the hamlet of Imin Taga as a child after inadvertently setting a fatal curse on the sheik\'s son. The title Azugh may derive from the Berber word for "great" or may represent the women unable to marry high priests. David Ben Barukh\'s shrine--located near Azrou n\'Bahamou and Oulad Berhil--was a popular pilgrimage site during Morocco\'s colonial period between 1912 and 1956, attracting visitors from all over Morocco and the Jewish diaspora.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>The Azugh Family:</strong> Other members of the Azugh family, which supposedly descends in an unbroken line from the First Temple era, are also recognized as saints. They trace their ancestry back to Phineas, the grandson of Aaron, the first high priest.<sup>2</sup> Venerated members of the family include Barukh Ben David (also known as Baba L\'Aziz) of Casablanca, David Ben Baruch of Essaouira, and Barukh Ben David (also known as Baba Doudou) of Taroudant.<sup>3</sup> Their graves in Taroudant and Casablanca are recognized as shrines, by both Jews and local Muslims. Several members of the Azugh family live in Casablanca, keeping the pilgrimage tradition and their holy status alive.<sup>4</sup></p><p><strong>Morocco: </strong>By the early 1200s, the Jews of Morocco gained the ruling Berber dynasty\'s permission to openly practice Judaism. Morocco became a haven for Jews fleeing persecution in Spain; such as after the anti-Jewish pogroms of 1391, and after the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, causing as many as twenty thousand Jews to arrive in Morocco.<sup>5</sup> By the seventeenth century, Jews lived in more than 250 communities in Morocco; Jewish traders were everywhere in the countryside, providing a connection between the coastal cities and the smaller communities of the Sahara.<sup>6</sup> During Spain\'s occupation of Tetouan between 1859-1862, many Jews fled from port cities to the countryside or even to Algeria. When the Cr&eacute;miuex Decree of 1870 granted French citizenship to Algerian Jews, many Moroccan Jews settled in Algeria. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Morocco had the largest Jewish population of any Arab country, numbering between 110,000 and 120,000 people (about 2.5 percent of the population) in 1912. The population reached a peak of around 280,000 in the 1950s.<sup>7</sup> Morocco gained independence in 1956, and a series of governmental decisions (including partially nationalizing the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle schools and temporarily forbidding postal relations with Israel) made many Jews eager to emigrate. Once emigration policies were relaxed in 1962, more than 130,000 Jews left Morocco over the next thirty years, usually settling in Canada, France, or other Western European countries.<sup>8</sup> In records from 2019, Morocco\'s Jewish population is around 2,100, only a fraction of what it used to be.<sup>9</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1]&nbsp;Oren Kosansky, &ldquo;Azugh, David Ben Barukh ha-Kohen,&rdquo; in <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>, ed.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>A silent walk through the abandoned Jewish cemetery of Ighil&rsquo;n\'Ogho reveals human bones, shattered graves, and one remarkably intact headstone in Hebrew. The village is located in the Talouine region of southern Morocco and once had a large Jewish population. Many of the local Jews were merchants and itinerant peddlers &ndash; often of saffron, a regional specialty.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Ighil n\'Ogho History:</strong> Ighil n&rsquo;Ogho was the central mellah in the Talouine region (Zagmouzen tribe) in southern Morocco, dating back to the sixteenth century, possibly even earlier.<sup>1</sup> It is estimated to have had around 350 inhabitants during the twentieth century, due to a 1936 census indicating 240 Jews living in the region, as well as the findings in this cemetery that is 1.2 miles away from the mellah (an established Jewish quarter, named after the salt marsh area in Fez where the first mellah was created<sup>2</sup>) (see <a href="../../detail/public/2532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).<sup>3</sup> The Jews of Ighil n&rsquo;Ogho held an array of occupations from jewelers to blacksmiths and cobblers to saddlers. The main languages they spoke were Judeo-Arabic and Berber. The centuries-old Jewish community fragmented, as the majority of the Jews migrated to Israel in 1963.<sup>4</sup></p><p><strong>Video Tour:</strong> This tour begins at the oldest end of the cemetery, where what seems to have once been a small ritual room now shows evidence of local Amazigh (Berber) women&rsquo;s ablutions; the women wash themselves inside in the superstitious hope of getting pregnant.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Based on photographs. Unsure of exact coordinates. &nbsp;Oujda (وجدة), Morocco.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Oujda History:</strong> In the eastern region of Morocco, near the border of Algeria, lies a city known as Oujda, established in 994 c.e. The Jewish community is comprised of an array of diverse backgrounds, from Jews who fled the persecution in the Iberian peninsula in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Amazighs (Berbers) who may have been Judaized, and Jews migrating from Algeria during the beginning of the Moroccan French protectorate in the twentieth century. In 1907, Jews were 20% of the total population (1,200 out of 6,000), most likely due to the influx of refugees during the time. In 1918, they were 11% of the population (2,000 out of 18,150). With the French protectorate taking charge in 1912, Jews in Oujda went from having dhimmi (protected) status under the Sultan, to becoming subjects of the Sultan, leading to Oujda Jews being more assimilated and westernized.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Oujda Mellah: </strong>Many Jews of Oujda lived in the mellah (an established Jewish quarter, named after the salt marsh area in Fez where the first mellah was created<sup>2</sup>), as well as the quarter known as the Ouled Amran. Oujda&rsquo;s mellah is much different from other mellahs throughout Morocco, as theirs allowed Muslim&rsquo;s to reside within the quarter, and it lacked a wall which normally encased others.<sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>International League Against Anti-Semitism (LICA):</strong> In 1927 Bernard Lecache, a French journalist, created the International League Against Anti-Semitism with the hopes of raising awareness about antisemitism and to mobilize against it. Initially the goal was to influence France and other European powers, but in 1934 LICA began to branch out to North Africa, particularly in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco.<sup>4 </sup>In 1934 antisemitic riots in Constantine, Algeria broke out, causing the death of many Jews.<sup>5</sup> Due to Morocco being a French protectorate, LICA had difficulty working with the Muslim community, but LICA was able to meet with Jewish communities, such as the one in Oujda. They eventually established a section of the Moroccan Federation of LICA in Oujda.<sup>6</sup></p><p><strong>Oujda Emigration:</strong> Oujda was a center for Jewish emigration, with it being a point of passage into Algeria, in the hopes to successfully arrive at their end goal - Palestine. Antisemitic beliefs and violence permeated, especially with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Most Jews found new homes in Israel, France, and Canada. In 1952, Jews made up 3.9% of Oujda&rsquo;s population (3,175 out of 80,718).<sup>7</sup></p><p><strong>Oujda-Jerada Riots: </strong>Due to Oujda being a center for Zionist migration, there was a large conflation of Zionism and Judaism, causing antisemitic beliefs, violence, and boycotts against the Jewish community. This tension began to boil over on June 6th, 1948, when Oujda Jews informed the police of possible antisemitic violence, but their pleas went unattended to. Capitalizing on the fact that both the military and the chief of police were out of town, June 7th, 1948 marked the start of the Oujda-Jerada Riots.<sup>8</sup> An array of accounts depict the event that led to the riot, with one stating that an argument in the marketplace led to a Jew stabbing a Muslim, yet another reports indicates that it was due to an altercation at the Algerian border between a Muslim guard and a Jewish barber, with the Muslim claiming the Jew had multiple grenades with the intention of killing Muslims.<sup>9</sup> It was true that a Jew did kill a Muslim (who was a Jew who had converted to Islam) due to an accusation of Zionist activity, but the bomb incident was false.<sup>10</sup> Nonetheless, both rumors spread, causing violence and antisemitism to permeate. Later on June 7th, a group from Oujda drove to the neighboring town of Jerada and continued the violence, with the riot finally ending on June 8th. Both towns were pillaged, property was destroyed (72,423,511 francs worth), hundreds were injured, and around forty Jews were killed.<sup>11</sup> These two days of violence led to an increase in emigration and Zionist activity amongst Zionist Moroccan Jews, and it also influenced Communist Moroccan Jews to stay and fight against imperialism and Zionism.<sup>12</sup> As of April 2021, descendants of the Jewish victims are asking the Moroccan government to recognize the Oujda-Jerada Riots of 1948 by establishing a monument, having a ceremony, and adding it to the education curriculum.<sup>13</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Jonathan G.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The small town of Ain Benimatthar, formerly known as Berguent after a French colonel, was the site of a Vichy punishment camp. This camp was unique among the network of Vichy camps stretching along the railroad from Oran, Algeria, south through Morocco. Prisoners of these camps were dispatched from Vichy France for the purpose of working on a Trans-Saharan railroad. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WPj_N7O3md8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Satloff%20among%20the%20righteous&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">According</a> to historian Robert Satloff, Berguent was &ldquo;the site of the only all-Jewish Vichy-era work camp in North Africa. At one point, 400 Jews were reportedly interned there. When an International Red Cross official visited the camp in July 1942, he counted 155; 90 percent of them had been volunteers to the French army or&hellip;to the Foreign Legion.&rdquo;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Driving from Oujda, the end of the train line in the East, south to Ain Benimatthar, the terrain is wide, arid, and starkly mountainous. The town is a world apart from the glitzy tourist paths to Marrakech or Fes; this place is in the middle of nowhere, a bubble of history in eastern Morocco. Vichy buildings turned school: Ask the boys if they know where the former Vichy camp buildings are located. They may be excited to help; apparently, the old French Vichy camp administration buildings had been turned into their school. Walk along the abandoned train tracks to the ruined train station. A five-minute walk further will bring you to a pink, new-looking building that is the Vichy camp administration location turned schoolhouse. This building was not where the prisoners slept, but more likely for the Vichy administrators. Robert Satloff <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WPj_N7O3md8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Satloff%20among%20the%20righteous&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">found</a> a first-person account written by a Polish-Jewish survivor of the camp: &ldquo;The camp consisted of holes in the ground or burrowed into the side of a hill. Each man had to provide his own shelter. All they found when they arrived were holes into which one man might wriggle on his stomach. They had to make larger caves in their own spare time.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>What remains:</strong> The physical remains of these memories come in the form of a run-down old train station, the trashed cemetery, and a strangely pink converted schoolhouse, between the wide blue sky and the shifting beige earth. All of this, along train tracks leading from distant Oran, southward.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Robert Satloff. <em>Among the Righteous: Lost Stories from the Holocaust&rsquo;s Long Reach into Arab Lands (</em>New York: Public Affairs, 2006), 63-64.</p></p>            <p><font color="#999999">© Digital Heritage Mapping, Inc.</font></p>',

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The town of Bou Denib (alternate spellings: Boudenib, بوذنيب) is located in southeastern Morocco in the central part of the Guir Valley, near a palm grove east of the Tafilalet, not far from the Algerian border, on the road that links Errachidia (formerly Ksar Souk) to Colombe B&eacute;char in southern Algeria.&nbsp;The Jews of this isolated, border town have long since left. But due primarily to the efforts of one native family, the community&rsquo;s cemetery has recently been restored.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Jews of Boudenib:&nbsp;</strong>Although its origins are unknown, a Jewish settlement seems to have existed in Boudenib at least as early the seventeenth century. Along with Bou Anan, Bou &lsquo;Arfa, Toulal, Talessint, and Gourrama (the latter dating only from the twentieth century), Boudenib represented the easternmost area of Jewish settlement in Tafilalet, whose main community was Sijilmasa until the fifteenth century. In the twentieth century, the Boudenib community consisted of two hundred families. The presence of a French garrison in the area was a stimulus to local commerce. The Jews of Boudenib, largely engaged in crafts and petty trade, benefited from this, expanding into supplying foodstuffs and other commodities to the troops. A point of pride for many of the Jews of Boudenib was the buriel of the holy rabbi Abba Abuḥaṣera, grandson of the holy rabbi Jacob Abuḥaṣera (1807&ndash;1880) in the Boudenib cemetery. Like many other nearby Jewish communities, the&nbsp;Boudenib community emigrated gradually to Israel in the years 1962 to 1966.</p><p><strong>French Occupation:</strong> In 1908, the French began their occupation of Boudenib,&nbsp;but local forces resisted for twenty years. In 1940, the Vichy government set up an internment camp where hundreds of Algerian Jewish and Muslim prisoners were interned under conditions befitting a concentration camp and over the next two years forced to build the Trans-Saharan Railway.&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Chetrit, Yossef. &ldquo;Boudenib,&rdquo; in <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>, edited by Norman A.

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>In a city whose name means &ldquo;without noise&rdquo;, the cemetery of Ouarzazate also sits silently. Surrounded by a high mud wall capped with a barbed-wire crown, the Jewish cemetery of Ouarzazate appears mostly to be an earthen field, with clumps of stones and a few concrete slabs marking old graves. Outside the walls are film studios where Hollywood classics like Star Wars have been shot. Inside the cemetery, the only &ldquo;blockbuster&rdquo; is an elegant shrine with black marble columns protecting the 400-year-old graves of two rabbis.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>City:</strong> Known as the &ldquo;gateway to the Sahara,&rdquo; Ouarzazate is an old trading depot, located strategically at the crossroads of three regions: the Atlas Mountains to the north, the Dra&rsquo;a Valley to the east, and the Dades Valley to the south. In the 20th Century, the French turned the town into an administrative center for the region and Ouarzazate swelled in size. Today, over 50,000 people live in the city, which is now known as the &ldquo;Hollywood of Morocco&rdquo; for the many film studios just outside the downtown. &ldquo;Lawrence of Arabia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gladiator&rdquo; among other Hollywood hits have been filmed in town.</p><p><strong>Jewish Community:</strong> In the 17th Century, the local ruler built a kasbah known as Taourirt (&ldquo;Hill&rdquo; in Tamazigh, the Amazigh (Berber) language), and Jews soon established a mellah just outside the palace. Many were merchants, peddlers, and jewelers. The original location of the mellah is believed to be within a few yards of the kasbah, but, according to oral history, one of the quarter&rsquo;&rsquo;s walls collapsed and a new mellah was built about 100 yards away. Almost no ruins of the old mellah remain. In 1954, 170 Jews lived in the mellah. Almost all had left by the 1960s, though one Jewish peddler of animal skins remained, living above the synagogue until he grew old. Today that synagogue is a carpet store, producing and selling Ouarzazate&rsquo;s distinctive woven carpets.</p><p><strong>Cemetery:</strong> The high wall surrounding the cemetery appears to be a relative new construction. Remnants of women&rsquo;s clothing atop some of the graves indicate that local Muslims often accessed the cemetery for fertility rituals (a common belief holds that a woman who wants to become pregnant should wash herself on a Jewish grave). Due to vandalism and to wear from the elements, no graves are fully intact and most are simply piles of rubble. A few small gravestones fragments with Hebrew writing are the only obvious markers of the cemetery&rsquo;s inhabitants.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yqG4osdOrm4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Ouarzazate Jewish Cemetery (Morocco)&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><strong>Shrine:</strong> The one well-maintained section of the cemetery is a 200 square foot pinkish building with a copula that protects the graves of two rabbis. Writing on their gravestones has worn away, but one is apparently named Ait Hemyas and both appear to have lived about 400 years ago. Black marble columns support the roof and intricate lamps light the hall, which is also lit by a skylight. The structure was apparently built by a former resident of the city named Meir Ben Barukh. He has hired a caretaker, who has a register of some of the individuals buried in the cemetery. The guardian&rsquo;s phone number is painted on the metal gate to the cemetery.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Aomar Boum.

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Figuig is an island of Morocco surrounded by Algeria. Located in southeastern Morocco, Figuig is a town composed of seven different communities, amid a leafy palm oasis in the shadow of Algerian peaks and desert. Like many oaseis in southern Morocco, Figuig once had a small Jewish population, reportedly numbering about one hundred Jews in its mellah (Jewish quarter).</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Figuig is accessible by the long stretch of highway from Oujda southward, snaking along the border with Algeria. On the road, one may see the occasional hitchhiking family or loner, waiting for who knows how long for a ride to an unknown destination. Stark desert mountains line the path along the dusty road, straight through the center of town of Figuig, which boasts an impressive and expansive palm oasis and wormwood tea sweetened with whole bricks of sugar.</p><p><strong>What remains:</strong> A mellah, including a locked up synagogue, as well as a cemetery at the far end of town are all that remains of the Jews of Figuig. The cemetery is enclosed by a square rock fence and a brown iron door that says &lsquo;mamnu&rsquo;aa al-dakhoul&rsquo; &mdash;entry is forbidden &mdash;in Arabic. A few larger graves are visible toward the back wall, but the rest seems to have fallen into ruin. The mellah is located closer to the main thoroughfare of the town at the end of the highway, accessible by walking under wooden over-head building arches, ducking around covered corridors and open alleys. All that remains of the synagogue is a wall that people identify as such, but it is locked and no one around seems to have the key. A crumbled archway leads into an open square, known as an open space belonging to the mellah. Across from the mellah is a modern basketball court as well as a modern school, which may have once housed a Jewish school.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br>  No sources have been provided. </p>            <p><font color="#999999">© Digital Heritage Mapping, Inc.</font></p>',

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The Alliance&nbsp;Isra&eacute;lite Universelle established schools in Essouria in the 1860s. These schools opened and closed throughout the 1860s and 70s, finally reopening permanently in 1888. The Anglo-Jewish Association also established a number of schools in Essouria. Some of the Jewish residents of Essouria were concerned by the opening of European schools, since they threatened their previously unquestioned leadership. [1]</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p>Founded in 1764, Essouria was home to a thriving Jewish community which migrated to the new port city from Agadir and other towns across Morocco [2].&nbsp; Early in its history, Essouria reportedly featured 27 synagogues. [3]&nbsp; Initially, Jews and Muslims lived side-by-side in Essouira. The village was unique; since the populations of Jews and Muslims were equal, neither was a minority [4]. The Jews had an important role in business ownership. However, Sultan Mawlāy Sulaymān issued a "dahir" (decree) in 1807 creating the Jewish "mellah" (quarter) in Essouria and requiring Jews to live there. Through the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Essouria\'s eminence as a port city began to decrease, and Casablanca became the French\'s principal port while Agadir became their southern port during the protectorate period. In 1951, the Jewish community in Essouria still numbered over 5,000 [5]. However, during the Six Day War in 1967, many Essouirian Jews began to leave. The wealthier ones could afford to, but some of the poorer ones had no choice but to stay [6]. Today there are reportedly 50 Jewish families in the city. [7]. But the Jewish-Arab culture of the past still is remembered today [8].</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Daniel Schroeter.

Explorer Walter B. Harris visited Zarkten during research for his book&nbsp;<em>Tafilet; the narrative of a journey of exploration in the Atlas mountains and the oases of the north-west Sahara</em> which was published in 1895, and reported a "considerable settlement of Jews at Zarkten." This Jewish community was once very important, but the majority of the community left during the 1950s and 1960s.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Situated on the dramatic sloping hillside of Mount Dersa overlooking the medina (old city), T&eacute;touan&rsquo;s Jewish cemetery (video <a href="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/0jKOKuMTZq39aYghW6hm" target="_blank">here</a>) was established 500 years ago. Aside from the remarkable vistas it commands, the cemetery (also known as the &ldquo;Castilian Cemetery&rdquo;) features many tombs with anthropomorphic engravings&mdash;a highly unusual feature for Jewish cemeteries. With an estimated 35,000 graves, the Jewish cemetery was among the largest in Morocco.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Roots:</strong> After T&eacute;touan was destroyed around 1400 by Castilian monarch Henry III, the city and its Jewish community were only reconstituted in the late 1400s. In 1530, Rabbi Haim Bibas came from Fez to establish rabbinic academies and synagogues, which soon gained an international reputation. Bibas&rsquo;s tomb in the cemetery features anthropomorphic imagery, a style that is traditionally shunned on Jewish tombs.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-HXQ9Hn0QoQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>T&eacute;touan Cemetery</strong>&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Stylings:</strong> Many graves are covered with designs of a round sun and flower or a design suggesting female breasts. Most are graves face west, toward Jerusalem. Tombstones in the older part of the cemetery often lack writing. Traditionally, a grave would include personal information only if the deceased had no descendants to carry on the family line.</p><p><strong>Bengualid:</strong> Also buried in the cemetery (in an umarked grave) is the legendary Rabbi Yitzhak Bengualid, a 19th Century scholar who in 1862 allowed the Paris-based Alliance Israelite to establish a French language school in T&eacute;touan. Bengualid&rsquo;s hiloula (a celebration on the anniversary of his death) is marked four days before the holiday of Purim. Jews from around the world still return every year for the celebration. The cemetery is open to the public and <a href="http://vanessapaloma.blogspot.com/2007/09/tetouans-jewish-cemetery.html" target="_blank">Mohammad</a> the caretaker happily gives tours.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>DiarnaInfo.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p><strong>The Synagogue in Rabat (رباط), Morocco.</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The synagogue Rabbi Shalom Zaoui is in the Mellah of Rabat. Located within the Bab Diouna and abuts the Muraille Andalouse, its Jewish character is marked by large stars of David on the door. Let us enter the history of this synagogue and of the Rabat Jewish community.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>The Synagogue:</strong> &nbsp;Through the bright red courtyard, one enters the synagogue, whose Moorish style is visible via trilobal shapes on the windows, lamps resembling mosque lamps, and ceramic tiles with geometric forms.i In earlier times, the synagogue used to house the rabbi. However, during a recent restoration during the last decade, the plan has been transformed to contain a courtyard with an arcade, a small shrine, kitchen and storage space. At the entrance to the synagogue in the courtyard, a bath was installed; at the other end of the courtyard is a large space containing an oven and leading into the women\'s gallery.ii &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Mellah:</strong> &nbsp;The synagogue is located in the Mellah, the Jewish quarter, whose particular history reflects that of Rabat Jews. The Rabat Mellah, which is more recent than other Moroccan Mellas (like the Fez, Marrakech, and Sal&eacute; ones), was planned and built in a singular moment between 1806 and 1807, when the Sultan Moulay Slimane ordered its creation in order to house the Jewish population of Rabat, which previously lived in the Medina. The Mellah was built on the site of fruit orchards. The site was chosen since it was within the walls of the Medina. It had a double function of separation and protection for the Jews. The Mellah had a political significance since its attacking was a vector of challenging the Sultan&rsquo;s political authority.iii</p><p>For the Jews, living in the mellah was a painful experience, which initiated a wave of emigration, particularly to South America. Many newly wealthy families converted to Islam.iv &nbsp;</p><p>Nowadays, many Jewish families live across the Mellah in the new city. Therefore, this area is named the Nouveau Mellah or new Mellah. The Centre de la Communaut&eacute; Israelite and the new synagogue are also located there.v In 1998, there were 3 Jewish families living in the Mellah.vi &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jews in Rabat:</strong> &nbsp;Jews have lived in Rabat since pre-islamic times. Rabat and its twin city Sal&eacute;, which is located on the opposite side of the Bou Regreg River (Ar. Wādī Abū Raqraq), were the only Moroccan ports never to have been captured by Christians. vii</p><p>The Sephardic &ldquo;megurashim&rdquo;, who were forced to leave Spain in the 15th century, tended to settle in the urban northern areas, which include Rabat, alongside Muslims from Al Andalus.viii In the 17th and 18th centuries, many Jews engaged in trading activities. They exported slaves, gold dust, ostrich feathers, dates, goat skins, indigo, linen, and wax to Europe and imported weapons. Jews occupied prominent positions in the administration of Rabat, serving as ambassadors to European powers with commercial interests in Morocco.</p><p>Trade fluctuated in the 19th and 20th centuries. When the French protectorate was declared in 1912, Rabat became Morocco&rsquo;s capital, and its significance grew.ix Jews and Muslims from Rabat share historical and social characteristics, which unify them despite religious differences.x</p><p>A high percentage of Jews tend to live in cities, such as Rabat, compared to Muslims, who tend to be more rural. In 1881, 5,000 Jews used to live in Rabat-Sal&eacute;.xi In 1947, there were more than 15,000 Jews in Rabat.xii After 1948, Moroccan Jewish population sharply decreased going from 265,000 in 1948 to 17,000 in 1976.xiii A wave of emigration started in 1949 when anti-Semitic measures were put forth in reaction to the creation of the State of Israel. Riots broke out in northern Morocco on June 4th, 1949, killing and injuring tens of Jews.xiv&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Moroccan independence of 1956, Jewish emigration has continued.xv Most of these emigrants went to France, the United States, Canada, and Israel.xvi&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p><strong>FOOTNOTES:</strong></p><p>i Roland Benzaken, &ldquo;La Synagogue Rabbin Chaloum Zaoui Mellah de Rabat,&rdquo; Souvenirs et R&eacute;cits D&rsquo;une Enfance &Agrave; Rabat, May 2, 2015, http://rol-benzaken.centerblog.net/6759-la-grande-synagogue-rabbi-chalomzaoui-rabat.

      title: 'AIU School at Mazagan, Morocco',
      excerpt: 'school',
      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Mazagan (also known as el Jadida), a fishing village and port on the Moroccan coast, was a frequent port of departure for Jews visiting the Iberian Peninsula in the 16th and 17th centuries. While the Jewish population fluctuated during that time, it began to increase after the Portuguese abandoned Mazagan in 1769.<sup>1</sup> The AIU established a school there in 1907, and in the 1963-64 academic year it had 268 students.<sup>2</sup> The school closed in the 1970s after most of the Jewish community emigrated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p>Since ancient times, Jewish people have lived in Morocco. During World War II, they endured much discrimination. However, after the war, the king of Morocco tried to encourage the people living in Morocco to be more tolerant toward Jews. The Jews in Morocco did face much discrimination and abuse, and some suicide bombers even tried to attack them. In response, the king has recently tried to encourage people to respect the Jews, and has even punished the attackers. Today, Morocco is one of the safest countries for Jews in the Arab world.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Today, many of the younger Jews study at universities outside of Morocco and do not return. As a result, the population of Jews in Morocco is decreasing, and there is a separation of the older and younger generations. In fact, the population of Jews in Morocco just before World War Two was 265,000, but the population of Jews in Morocco in 2006 was 2,500.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Some primary sources note the difficulties of teaching at an AIU School in Mazagan; as a result, they underscore the courage of the people who left their homes to teach in Morocco. Indeed, these people were dedicated to a noble service. One letter written by Messody Pariente, a teacher in Mazagan, expresses the difficult situation faced by the AIU teachers. Some people were afraid of sending their daughters to teach in Mazagan. To the President of the AIU who was relunctant to send a young teacher to Mazagan, Pariente boldly replied: &ldquo;You express fear for the security of a young girl who would come all alone to Morocco. She would not be alone. She would be with me, staying with me if it is necessary&hellip;. This lack of tranquility could last for years. Is it because of this that you are going to suspend your work in Morocco? We must continue to work there, now more than ever; it will not be difficult to find in your personnel a young girl courageous enough to accept the post in Mazagan&rdquo;.<sup>5</sup> Pariente&rsquo;s message reveals the moral importance the teachers saw in their work. The &ldquo;lack of tranquility&rdquo; in Morocco challenged the AIU administration to respect and see the moral importance of teaching there.<sup>6</sup> Teaching in an area that faced turmoil, the teachers had to be courageous. If these people left their homes to go to Morocco, they must have seen the importance of their work, that motivated them to make such a sacrifice.</p><p><strong>AIU Schools</strong>&nbsp;The Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle, founded in Paris in 1860, became a major force in modern Jewish education through its goal of fighting for Jewish rights and emancipation. In the heyday of the AIU in the early 1900s, it operated 183 schools with 43,700 students in an area that stretched from Iran to Morocco.<sup>7</sup> In addition to providing a modern French primary and secondary education, many schools had apprenticeship programs to teach agricultural, artisanal, and commercial skills. The schools also emphasized modern Jewish learning: religion, Jewish history, and Hebrew.<sup>8</sup> In most cases, the AIU received a request from the local community to establish a school; while the communities were expected to pay for the school&rsquo;s upkeep, this was not always possible, and in many schools the majority of the students did not pay tuition. The AIU is active in Jewish education to this day, but most of its schools are now located in France, Canada, and Israel.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Women\'s Education</strong>&nbsp;AIU schools were the first mass education system for girls in the Middle East.<sup>10</sup> Initially the curricula at girls&rsquo; schools differed from the boys&rsquo; schools (featuring sewing, embroidery, and knitting) but by the end of the 19th century the curricula became more similar, driven by a trend of coeducational schools. The AIU heavily emphasized moral education for girls, hoping to instill principles that the students would eventually pass on to their children.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1]&nbsp;Tavim, Jose Alberto.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>In a small cemetery on the outskirts of Asjen (أسجن), Morocco, a large olive tree shades a pile of stones that protect a tomb. The stones are covered with drips of wax, the remains of candles left by pilgrims visiting the shrine of Rabbi Amram Ben Diwan. The tomb of the 18th-century rabbi, one of Morocco\'s most popular saints, once attracted thousands of visitors every year and was famous for miraculous cures of illnesses and disabilities.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Rabbi Amram Ben Diwan</strong> Born in Jerusalem in the early eighteenth century, Amram Ben Diwan moved to Hebron before being sent to Morocco in 1743 to collect funds to support yeshivot in the Holy Land.<sup>1</sup> He established a yeshiva at Wazan, near Asjen, but spent most of his time travelling from village to village in Morocco in order to teach and raise funds. The Rabbi was well-known for his miracles&mdash;while most were healings, members of a wedding procession who taunted him as they passed him in the street found themselves inexplicably paralyzed&mdash;and was respected for always having his door open to people experiencing misfortunes.<sup>2</sup> After ten years of traveling Morocco, he grew homesick and returned to Hebron. There, he disguised himself as a Muslim to visit the Cave of the Patriarchs: the Ottoman government closely controlled access to the cave, having made it a crime for non-Muslims to visit the site. Another visitor to the cave recognized him, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Not daring to stay in Hebron or go to Jerusalem, he returned to Morocco instead and resumed his life of teaching and traveling.<sup>3</sup></p><p><strong>The Rabbi\'s Tomb</strong> Rabbi Amram Ben Diwan&rsquo;s son, Ha&iuml;m Ben Diwan, fell seriously ill in 1781.<sup>4 </sup>The rabbi prayed for Ha&iuml;m&rsquo;s life to be spared and offered his own life as a substitute. Amram Ben Diwan died soon after, while his son recovered.<sup>5 </sup>His tomb in Asjen soon became a popular pilgrimage site for Jews and Muslims alike and he became one of the most well-known saints in Morocco; his son continued his work, traveling and teaching throughout Morocco.<sup>6 </sup>The shrine was a site of frequent miracles, with pilgrims being cured of illnesses, blindness, and paralysis. A French sergeant whose son had been paralyzed by illness was skeptical of the miracles, and declared that if his son could be cured, he would build a road to the shrine. His son&rsquo;s paralysis disappeared after a visit to the rabbi&rsquo;s tomb, and the sergeant helped build a road that greatly increased accessibility to the shrine.<sup>7</sup></p><p><strong>An Eyewitness Description of Pilgrimage</strong> Marcel B&eacute;nabou describes his family\'s pilgrimage to the tomb of Rabbi Amram Ben Diwan when he was young: &ldquo;From the pilgrimage itself, I recalled only a few images, a few odors. It was, in the midst of a mountainous setting far more imposing than my familiar Zerhoun, a sort of untidy caravansary: a collection of tents, each of them sheltering a large family, amid flies and beggars. During the day, there was a crazy, kermis-like atmosphere, with singing, dancing, and music, and a strong odor of barbecued mutton rising up everywhere. But at night, the whole life of the strange encampment came together around the saint&rsquo;s tomb, which was transformed into a giant inferno: a swarming and noisy mass of men and women thrown together, constantly tossing candles on it, begging the saint to grant their prayers amid the odor, at first sweet but later nauseating, of melted wax&rdquo;.<sup>8</sup></p><p><strong>Saint Worship in Morocco </strong>While Judaism is not a religion that venerates saints, Jewish communities in Morocco frequently developed cults of local saints--including Rabbi Amram Ben Diwan--which became a significant cultural characteristic. In both Jewish and Muslim communities of Morocco, figures of "outstanding erudition, devotion, and compassion" came be seen as saints.<sup>9</sup> While most Jewish saints in Morocco had a strictly local character, with veneration limited to a village or a few communities in the same vicinity, Amram Ben Diwan was one of a few "national" saints, whose tombs attracted pilgrims from all over the country.<sup>10</sup></p><p><strong>Jewish Community of Asjen</strong> The commune of Asjen is roughly four miles from the larger town of Ouezzane in the foothills of the Jbala Mountains. The area is famous for its olive oil production.<sup>11 </sup>A 2004 census showed a population of 13,113 in Asjen, but most of the Jewish population of the town emigrated to Israel in the 1950s. The town\'s mellah is now mostly abandoned.<sup>12 </sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Eric Ross, "The shrine of Rabbi Amram ben Diwane in Azj&egrave;n, Morocco," <em>Eric Ross, Academic</em>, 20 September 2011.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Chefchouan Mellah in Chefchouan (Chofchouan, Chefchaouen,&nbsp;الشاون,&nbsp;شفشاون), Morocco.</p><p>Nestled in the breathtaking Rif Mountains in the Northwest of Morocco, the city of Chefchaouen is remarkable for its picturesque blue buildings. The city was once home to a sizeable Jewish population credited with starting the tradition of painting the blue-hued structures which still line the narrow streets. In the 1990s, hoping to maximize the city&rsquo;s tourism potential, residents outside of the mellah began to paint their buildings in similarly soothing shades of blue.[i]</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>The Chefchaouen Mellah :</strong></p><p>In the 15th century, Chefchaouen was established by Jews and Moors fleeing the Spanish Reconquista.[ii] It is believed that the city&rsquo;s trademark blue buildings are meant to be a reminder of the presence of God, reminiscent of tekhelet, an ancient blue dye used for weaved prayer shawls.[iii]</p><p>The term mellah represented the separate physical areas demarcated for the Jews in Moroccan cities and towns.[iv] Originally the word was used to describe a district in the city of Fes where Jews were forced to live in the 15th century, but it later took on broader applications for official and unofficial areas where Jews lived, surrounded by a spatial boundary separating them from Muslims.[v] Over the centuries the meaning of the word &ldquo;mellah&rdquo; expanded even further, coming to describe not only areas themselves but their residents and communities.[vi] For instance, in rural Berber villages the mellah could represent one or two dozen Jewish families occupying a block or street.[vii] For the reigning power, the construction of a mellah became a tool for asserting authority over the Moroccan people by signaling control over the non-Muslim population.[viii] Towards the end of the 16th century, the young Sa&rsquo;di dynasty built a mellah in Marrakesh, asserting and displaying royal authority. Later, the Alaouites, who came to power in the 17th century and rule to present day, similarly built mellahs in which Jews were required to live, such as in the one-time capital city of Meknes and later in Tetouan, Sal&eacute;, Rabat, and Essaouira.[ix]</p><p>The earliest buildings in Chefchaouen&rsquo;s Mellah date to the 16th century and, with their courtyards, small balconies, and tiled roofs, strongly evoke the Andalusian architecture once familiar to many of the city&rsquo;s Jews.[x][xi] However, most of the local Jews resided outside of the confines of the medina until the sultan&rsquo;s command in the 18th century.[xii] Because of the Jews&rsquo; belated move into the mellah within the city walls, the area was known as Mellah el-Jedid, or &ldquo;new mellah.&rdquo;[xiii] The mellah was established in the space currently sitting between the Kasbah and Bab el Ain, a small arch serving as the main entrance to the medina at the intersection of Avenue Hassan II and Rue Moulay Ali Ben Rachid.[xiv]</p><p><strong>Jews in Morocco:</strong></p><p>Under Alouite rule, which began in 1631, Jews lived in over 250 different settlements throughout Morocco.[xv] They constituted the largest concentration of Jews of any country in the Islamic world.[xvi] Though in the last century most of Morocco&rsquo;s Jews emigrated to Europe and Israel, some still remain. Today, the most significant remaining Jewish population is that of Casablanca, where over 5,000 Jews live and attend over 30 different synagogues.[xvii] And though the city&rsquo;s Jews are long gone, Chefchaouen&rsquo;s inhabitants continue to paint their buildings in the stunning blue shades which complement the whitewashed walls and reflect the beauty of the sky above.[xviii]</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p><strong>Endnotes:</strong></p><p>[i] Hollowell, Thomas. &ldquo;The Jewish Quarters (Mellahs) of Morocco&rsquo;s Medinas.&rdquo; Journey Beyond Travel, October 14, 2014, accessed July 7, 2017, https://www.journeybeyondtravel.com/blog/jewish-mellahs-morocco.html.</p><p>[ii] Ibid.</p><p>[iii] Ibid.</p><p>[iv] Schroeter, Daniel, Yaron Tsur, and Mohammed Hatimi. &ldquo;Morocco.&rdquo; Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World, October 1, 2010, accessed July 7, 2017, http://0-referenceworks.brillonline.com.luna.wellesley.edu/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/morocco-COM_0015720?s.num=0&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world&amp;s.q=morocco.</p><p>[v] Ibid.</p><p>[vi] Ibid.</p><p>[vii] Ibid.</p><p>[viii] Ibid.</p><p>[ix] Ibid.</p><p>[x] Peters, Lucas.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p><strong>Tetouan Synagogue in Tetouan (تطوان), Morocco.</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Tetuan, a coastal city in Northern Morocco, has a long Jewish history. community.&nbsp; Since it had one of the most important Jewish populations in the Maghreb, Tetuan gained the nickname of &ldquo;Little Jerusalem.&rdquo;[1]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>The Synagogue:</strong></p><p>Of the 16 synagogues which once were found in the Mellah (the Jewish neighborhood), only one synagogue remains, considering that<br />there are less than 50 Jews in the city.&nbsp; Nowadays, the Mellah&rsquo;s inhabitants are mostly poor peasants. The well-kept synagogue and the gated Jewish cemetery contrast with the chaos of Tetuan\'s Muslim cemetery.</p><p>Once a year, the members of the Jewish-Moroccan Cultural Patrimony Foundation, based in Casablanca, come to celebrate Shabbat services and visit the tomb of Rabbi Isaac Ben Walid, for whom the synagogue is named. Otherwise, it is a shining and empty building that serves mostly as a reminder that Jews once lived there.[i]</p><p>Rabbi Isaac Ben Walid (1777&ndash;1870) was respected and venerated as a spiritual leader, whose &ldquo;saintliness&rdquo; and &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; were remarkable.[ii] His book &ldquo;Va-Yomer Yiẓḥak&rdquo; (2 vols., Leghorn, 1855) serves as a formidable source of information about the history of the Jewish community of Tetu&aacute;n.[iii]</p><p>The large number of Spanish and Portuguese Jews who settled in Morocco had an impact on the liturgy which was chanted in the Tetuan synagogue. The secular ballads, popular types of narrative songs, served to indicate tunes for hymns.[iv] One can point out that nowhere else were Sephardic Jews able to preserve their language and customs.[v]</p><p><strong>Tetuan Jewish History:</strong></p><p>Sephardic Jews who had been expulsed from Spain in 1492 settled in Tetuan. Due to favoritism from local Muslim rulers, Jews were the almost exclusively maritime trade merchants until the 20th century. While relationships between Jews and Muslim were overall &ldquo;excellent&rdquo;, Jews were occasionally persecuted.[vi]</p><p>One such persecution occurred from 1790 to 1792. A new king began a persecution Tetuan Jews, which then spread to the rest of Northern Morocco. This was based on the fact that, while he was an &ldquo;outlaw&rdquo;, who was fighting against his father,[vii] Jews had refused to lend him money. The &ldquo;pogrom&rdquo; which ensued was devastating.[viii] Several accounts detail these events. According to one of them, the king ordered the Jews to gather in a single place while the Muslims robbed them. The head of a Jew who had served the king&rsquo;s father was placed in the city.[ix] A court historian described the events similarly, and added that &ldquo;Many people profited from them [from the Jews].&rdquo;[x]</p><p>Spain, whose colonization of Morocco progressed during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries and whose protectorate<br />officially lasted from 1912 to 1956, impacted the Jews of Tetuan. The Spanish interaction with the Jews can be described through Spanish literature. The Spanish, conscious of their country&rsquo;s Jewish heritage, could communicate with Sephardic Jews from Tetuan, whose language they considered primitive and outdated. While a violently anti-Semitic Christian uses descriptions that support his anti-Jewishness, Manuel Ortega underlines the common cultural traits between the Sephardic Jews and the Spanish while Cesar Juarros y Ortega explores without prejudice the characteristics of the Jews and doubts of the benefits for the Moroccan population of the civilizing mission of the Spanish.[xi] &nbsp;</p><p>In the city of Tetuan, the number of Jewish residents generally ranged between 3,000 and 8,000 souls.[xii] &nbsp;Most Jews of the city were artisans, merchants, and peddlers.[xiii] Since 1948, the Tetuan Jewish population has declined.

The town is named for Ahl Seforu, the Judaizing Berber tribe who settled on its banks, and subsequently conquered by Idirs II, son of the founder of Morocco&rsquo;s first Islamic Dynasty, in the early 9th century. While Sefrou&rsquo;s Jewish population has diminished from a high of 33-44% in the 1930s-40s, the cemetery is currently being restored by the small remnant community and with contributions from expatriates. Headstones have been mounted within cement monuments, many of which honor the memory of a group of merchants who died in a truck accident, while others commemorate the victims of the 1950 flood. The cemetery includes a number of &ldquo;saints,&rdquo; including Moshe Elbaz, the Masters of the Cave, Eliahou Harraoch, David Arazil, and Rabbi Rapyhael Moshe el-Baz.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br>  No sources have been provided. </p>            <p><font color="#999999">© Digital Heritage Mapping, Inc.</font></p>',

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The shrine of Rabbi David UMoshe is located in Timzerit, a remote area in Morocco\'s Atlas Mountains.&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Rabbi David UMoshe:</strong>&nbsp;The year of&nbsp;David UMoshe&rsquo;s appearance in southern Morocco is uncertain, as accounts place his appearance at either 900 or 250 years ago. Most accounts, however, agree that when he arrived in the High Atlas Mountains, he found the local villages ravaged by an epidemic. One of his foundational miracles revolved around the ending of his earthly life, which he is said to have willingly given up in exchange for the lives of the afflicted population. Traditionally, it is said that he came to Morocco as a rabbinical emissary (shadar or meshullaḥ) in order to&nbsp;raise funds for his yeshiva in Jerusalem.</p><p><strong>The Grave:</strong>&nbsp;Until well into the twentieth century, David u-Moshe&rsquo;s grave in Timzerit was marked only by an unadorned rock. It attracted local pilgrims from southern Morocco, especially at the time of the saint&rsquo;s anniversary of his death, called <em>hillula</em> (lit. wedding celebration, so-called because on that day he was united with the Divine) on the first of the Hebrew month of <em>Ḥeshvan</em> (October/November). Some Muslim residents of the area also regarded the grave site as sacred and associated it with miracles of healing.&nbsp;In the twentieth century, a shrine complex was constructed, then enlarged and refurbished, to accommodate the growing number of pilgrims from throughout Morocco and its Jewish diaspora. Other sites devoted to David UMoshe exist in Safed, Ofakim, Ashkelon, Gan Yavneh, and Moshav Aderet. Since the end of the twentieth century, Israeli pilgrims have also been returning to Morocco to visit the saint&rsquo;s original resting place.</p><p>Watch the video below to learn more about the site and some of the traditions surrounding the celebration of Rabbi David UMoshe\'s&nbsp;<em>hillula</em>:</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Te6wZKwRAYI" width="854" height="510" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Shrine of David Umoshe</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It includes an old cemetery, a large synagogue, and guest rooms for hundreds of pilgrims who visit the rabbi&rsquo;s grave each year for his <em>hillula</em> (celebration on the anniversary of death).</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Kosansky, Oren. <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>. s.v.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Rabbi Shmuel Abu Hatzeira is the grandson of the legendary Moroccan rabbi known as the Abir Yaakov and the first cousin of the Moroccan-Israeli iconic rabbi the Baba Sali. His tomb in the Erfoud cemetery was once exposed to the elements, covered only by a small roof with no walls. In recent years, a formal complex has been built around his grave, including a large function hall where guests can celebrate his annual hiloula (pilgrimage).&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Shrine:</strong> The cemetery contains several hundred other graves, most arrayed in a series of rows. Some of the graves have stones placed on top of them, the result of a traditional Jewish custom where relatives place a few pebbles atop grave stones as a kind of memorial. A Muslim guardian lives on the premises with his family, including a young daughter who often wanders among the tombs. He is familiar with the history of the Abu Hatzeira clan and often greets visitors from around the world who come on pilgrimages to the shrine.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BqfG9BXOTTU" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Tomb of Shmuel Abu Hatzeira in Erfoud, Morocco&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><strong>Community:</strong> In 1954, about one-third of the inhabitants of the new section of Erfoud were Jews. On Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, all shops were closed &ndash; including those owned by non-Jews &ndash; because there was no one to trade with. Yaakov Benhamou was then the head of the local community, and Mukhluf Krispin was the young head of the local Talmud Torah Jewish day school. The Baba Sali had a grand, new synagogue in town that was known as &ldquo;The Rav&rsquo;&rsquo;s Synagogue.&rdquo; There were Jewish quarters, or mellahs, in many of the surrounding villages, including Ksar Zrigat and Ma&rsquo;adid to the north; Tijimi and Joarf to the west; and Sifa and El-Glagla to the south (though in 1954 only the last three villages still had Jewish inhabitants).</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Bar-Asher, Moshe.&nbsp;<em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>.

      excerpt: 'school',
      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Demnate, a town in Morocco\'s High Atlas Mountains, has been a home to Jews since the 12th century.&nbsp;&nbsp; An AIU school was founded in Demnate in 1932 in the High Atlas Mountains. It caused the spread of modernization and French culture to Demnate. In fact, many of the Jewish students at the AIU school took on even French names.&nbsp; Seven years after the school was founded in 1932, it had ninety-nine students, and in 1951 the school had eighty-five boys and seventy girls enrolled. Eleanor Roosevelt visited the school in 1957 during her travels in Morocco.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p>Demnate was a town in the mountains of Morocco. Many Muslims lived here, but a Jewish community settled early in the 12th century. The Jewry here were farmers, craftsemen, and artisans.&nbsp; The Muslims and Jews happily coexisted in Demnate from the early 12th century until the mid-nineteenth century.</p><p>From the 1860s until the 1880s, a local governor started abuses and humiliation toward the Jews. More Muslims began abusing the Jews. However, the AIU schools&rsquo; endeavors helped the Jews. Some of the schools contacted a French government authority who then contacted the sultan of Demnate, requesting a cease in abuses. As a result, the sultan sent out a law demanding a stop to the abuse.</p><p>Despite the schools\' efforts, writings show that, since 1885, the Muslims had forced the Jews to buy goods against their will, had forced the Jews to work for free, had forced the Jews to give up their farm animals, and had forced the Jews to give up their valuable goods, including leather. However, under French rule, the condition of the Jewry improved. Still, many Jews have fled Morocco; few live there today.</p><p>Since ancient times, Jewish people have lived in Morocco. During World War 2, they endured much discrimination. However, after the war, the king of Morocco tried to encourage the people living in Morocco to be more tolerant toward Jews. The Jews in Morocco did face much discrimination and abuse, and some suicide bombers even tried to attack them. In response, the king has recently tried to encourage people to respect the Jews, and has even punished the attackers. Today, Morocco is one of the safest countries for Jews in the Arab world.</p><p>Our worldwide-connected human culture has impacted Jews in Morocco today. Many of the younger Jews study at universities outside of Morocco and do not return. As a result, the population of Jews in Morocco is decreasing, and there is a separation of the older and younger generations. In fact, the population of Jews in Morocco just before World War Two was 265,000, but the population of Jews in Morocco in 2006 was 2,500.</p><p><strong>AIU Schools</strong>&nbsp;The Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle, founded in Paris in 1860, became a major force in modern Jewish education through its goal of fighting for Jewish rights and emancipation. In the heyday of the AIU in the early 1900s, it operated 183 schools with 43,700 students in an area that stretched from Iran to Morocco. In addition to providing a modern French primary and secondary education, many schools had apprenticeship programs to teach agricultural, artisanal, and commercial skills. The schools also emphasized modern Jewish learning: religion, Jewish history, and Hebrew. In most cases, the AIU received a request from the local community to establish a school; while the communities were expected to pay for the school&rsquo;s upkeep, this was not always possible, and in many schools the majority of the students did not pay tuition. The AIU is active in Jewish education to this day, but most of its schools are now located in France, Canada, and Israel.</p><p><strong>Women\'s Education</strong>&nbsp;AIU schools were the first mass education system for girls in the Middle East. Initially the curricula at girls&rsquo; schools differed from the boys&rsquo; schools (featuring sewing, embroidery, and knitting) but by the end of the 19th century the curricula became more similar, driven by a trend of coeducational schools. The AIU heavily emphasized moral education for girls, hoping to instill principles that the students would eventually pass on to their children.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Berenbaum, Michael, and Fred Skolnik.

      excerpt: 'synagogue',
      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The Haim Pinto Synagogue, named for its founder, the famous 18th century rabbi and miracle-worker Haim Pinto, is one of two remaining synagogues in the city of Essaouira.<sup>1</sup> While only 50 Jewish families still live in Essaouira, it remains an active synagogue and was renovated several years ago. Located on the second floor of a three-story building, the synagogue is a single large room, with beautiful hanging lamps and woodwork that has been painted a brilliant shade of light blue.<sup>2</sup></p></p>            <p><p><strong>Rabbi Haim Pinto</strong>&nbsp;Haim Pinto was born in Agadir, Morocco, on July 1, 1749. His father died when he was twelve; the same year, an earthquake devastated much of Agadir, and many of the Jewish survivors settled in Mogador (now Essaouira).<sup>3</sup> Pinto had been known for the miracles that he performed even as a child, and in 1769 he became Dayan of the city at the young age of twenty.<sup>4</sup> He served as Chief of the Rabbinical Court for more than seventy years, during which time he founded one of the two synagogues that still exist in Essaouira today.<sup>5</sup> In addition to being a prolific writer (he published many judicial decisions and rabbinic commentaries, most of which have been lost), he was accepted as a saint and miracle-worker within his own lifetime. Rabbi Pinto died on September 28, 1845, aged 96. In the twentieth century he became a popular subject for Moroccan hagiographies; his grave remains a major pilgrimage destination.<sup>6&nbsp;</sup></p><p><strong>Essaouira</strong>&nbsp;Essaouira, known as Mogador until the end of French colonial rule in the 1960s, was one of Morocco&rsquo;s largest and most cosmopolitan Jewish communities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Many of Morocco&rsquo;s major Jewish families settled in the city in the first few decades after its establishment in 1764, and worked as key intermediaries in Morocco&rsquo;s domestic and international trade.<sup>7</sup> An 1807 decree required the Jewish residents to move to a mellah (a separate Jewish quarter), but several merchants were exempted from the decree.<sup>8</sup> In the 19th century, the Jewish population of Mogador fluctuated between 30 and 50 percent of the city&rsquo;s total population; there may have been as many as 10,000 Jews living in the city at one point.<sup>9</sup> Trade began to diminish in the late 1800s as the French began to develop Casablanca as their principal trading port; many major merchant families went bankrupt or left Mogador. The majority of the Jewish population emigrated in the 1960s; by 1980, only fifty families remained in the city.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1]&nbsp;Joundi, Alice.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Sidi Al Ayachi camp, Azzemour (Azmmur ⴰⵣⵎⵎⵓⵔ أزمور), Morocco (المغرب&lrm;&lrm;).</p><p>A World War II internment camp for Europeans (Jewish and non-Jewish) located across the river from Azzemour. The camp functions today as a hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of the Second World War, thousands of North African Jews were interned by the European powers which controlled the area.[i] Germany, Italy, and Vichy France relocated Jews to at least 30 such sites in Morocco, with at least another 37 camps in both Algeria and Tunisia, and 6 in Libya.[ii]&nbsp;Other than the small number who were incarcerated for their political activities, the majority of Moroccan Jews did not face imprisonment in the camps under Mohammed V but did endure the harsh conditions of the mellahs in which they were forced to live.[iii] Instead, Vichy sites such as the Sidi Al Ayachi camp throughout eastern Morocco and western Algeria housed two thousand European Jewish men, largely those who been living in France illegally or who had served in the French army or the Foreign Legion.[iv] Harsh conditions awaited these Jews, many of whom were deported from France and sent to live as forced laborers alongside European political prisoners on the Trans-Sahara railroad.[v] The Jews were the only group represented at the camps targeted for their religious views, and one camp along the railroad, Berguent, consisted entirely of Jews.[vi] European and Arab guards imposed strict conditions in the camps; prisoners routinely faced torture and death.[vii]</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Sidi Al Ayachi</strong></p><p>Located near the Moroccan city of Azemmour, 75 km southwest of Casablanca, the Sidi Al Ayachi camp was surrounded by a barbed wire fence and consisted of 15 buildings that had formerly constituted a military camp.[viii] While other Vichy camps consisted largely of political prisoners, places like Sidi Al Ayachi housed Jews who were termed &ldquo;refugees,&rdquo; individuals who had been apprehended for arriving in Morocco without the necessary transit visas and permits.[ix] The site was unusual in that it housed not only Jewish men, many hailing from Germany and Austria, but also women, children, elderly and the disabled.[x] Political prisoners were also mixed in with the inmates. Much of what is currently known of the camp today is derived from the accounts of Norwegian sailors who were sent to the camp following the capture of their ship by the Vichy.[xi] The mixed populace was guarded by local Arabs as well as a band of Senegalese troops.[xii] This use of foreign guards is logical in light of the various reports from other Vichy camps which detail the sympathy many of the Arab Moroccan guards harbored for the Jews they oversaw.[xiii] Though the inmates of Sidi Al Ayachi on the whole were not subject to brutality at the hands of their overseers, they had to contend with many other hardships. As one former Jewish-Czech survivor of the camp put it, &ldquo;We were not actually mistreated, but there was much hunger, suffering, and sickness, brought about by overcrowding, poor diet, inadequate sanitary facilities, and the extreme heat of the Moroccan summer, occasionally accompanied by sandstorms which penetrated everything.&rdquo;[xiv] Poor straw mattresses and unsanitary communal toilets served the inmates.[xv] Though it was considered the least harsh of the Vichy camps, the population there saw insufficient quantities of substandard food, sheets, blankets, clothes, and other necessities.[xvi]</p><p><strong>Vichy Camps</strong></p><p>Following the British-and-American-led invasion of North Africa on November 8, 1942, Morocco joined the Allies.[xvii] At the time of their arrival, European Jews at Camp Sidi Al Ayachi numbered 450.[xviii] At a conference in Casablanca the next January, the Allies signed a military agreement.[xix] Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily in July of 1943, marked the approach to the end of German-occupied Europe.[xx] The North African camps were torn down between late 1942 and early 1943, though construction on the Trans Saharan railroad continued for many years with German and Italian prisoners.[xxi]</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Coordinates courtesy of Dr. Corine Berghuis.

      title: 'Tomb of Rabbi Shlomo ben Lhensh at Ourika Valley, Morocco',
      excerpt: 'shrinetomb',
      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Perched on the edge of a mountain above a river valley sits the 500 year-old tomb of an emissary from the land of Israel who died while on a fundraising trip in southern Morocco. The Rabbi Shlomo (Solomon) has been given the moniker &ldquo;Ben Lhans&rdquo; (&ldquo;Son of the Snake&rdquo;) and remains one of the most revered Jewish saints in Morocco, including by Muslims, who call him &ldquo;Mul Asguine.&rdquo; What makes his tomb even more remarkable is a man who has resided there for over 30 years: Hananiyah Alfassi, the last Berber Jew in the Ourika Valley. Hannaniyah guards the rabbi&rsquo;s tomb, welcoming visitors and pilgrims from around the world.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Ourika&rsquo;s Berber Jews:</strong> While today most Moroccan Berbers are Muslim, there was once a large Berber Jewish population in North Africa. After Arab conquerors arrived 1,300 years ago, not all Berbers converted to Islam. In the 1950s, the Ourika Valley, where the rabbi&rsquo;s tomb lies, had 300 Jewish families, two synagogues, and several Jewish schools. Many members of the community would make pilgrimages (&ldquo;hilulot&rdquo;) to the tombs of righteous men and women, to celebrate holidays and to invoke their memory as intermediaries to God.</p><p><strong>The Rabbi:</strong> The many legends that surround the life of the &ldquo;Son of the Snake&rdquo; rabbi are chronicled in Issachar Ben-Ami&rsquo;s Saint Veneration among the Jews in Morocco. Rabbi Shlomo appears to have come from Israel to southern Morocco, crossing North Africa by mule, as many emissaries did on fundraising missions for study halls in the Holy Land. Why he died and how he ended up buried on the edge of a mountain outside a Jewish cemetery remains the subject of many legends. Hannaniyah offers his own explanation, which attributes many miraculous feats to the rabbi.</p><p><strong>The Site:</strong> The tomb of Rabbi Shlomo was once reached only by an 8 kilometer donkey ride, though today a paved road through the valley passes by his tomb. In 1976, donors from around the world built an elegant marble tombstone over the site. Later, a wealthy woman, whose prayers at Rabbi Shlomo&rsquo;s tomb were answered, funded the renovation of the tomb complex, which includes several guest rooms for visitors (some of whom come to visit for a week or more). Marked by an exterior sign in Hebrew, the pink structure is just off the main road winding along the mountainside.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/r0SL23GWt8M" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Diarna Insights No. 3: Son of the Snake&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><strong>The Guardian:</strong> Hananiyah Alfassi is the son of Lalla Sa&rsquo;ada Alfassi, who guarded Rabbi Shlomo&rsquo;s tomb until she died in 1978 and whose grave outside the entrance to the rabbi&rsquo;s tomb has also become a pilgrimage site. Hannaniyah, whose last name indicates his ancestors hail from the city of Fez, is the last Berber Jew in the Ourika Valley. When he was younger, he worked olive presses and traded crafts. Most of the local Jewish community immigrated to Israel in the 1960s, but he remained along with his mother and wife, Yamna, who died in the late 1990s. The couple tried moving to Israel, but Hananiyah had a stroke right before he was set to leave and took it as a sign he should remain to guard the rabbi.</p><p><strong>Visiting:</strong> Many local tour guides know the shrine complex and can direct tourists to the spot. Hannaniyah, who lives in the complex, is generally around and eager to receive guests. In return for a few Moroccan dirhams, he happily blesses visitors. The question remains, though, who will guard the rabbi&rsquo;s tomb after he is gone? In the meantime, Hannaniyah is the living memory of the region&rsquo;s ancient Jewish community and its traditions.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Issachar Ben-Ami. <em>Saint Veneration Among the Jews in Morocco</em>, (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998).

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Pilgrims come to the town of Krandou, just north of Errachidia, to this cemetery and the periodically open synagogue nearby as a stop on the way to other shrines, as well as to pay homage to the three largely forgotten rabbis buried here: Rabbi Yahia Lahlou, Rabbi Moul Tria, and Rabbi Moul Sedra. Little is known about the three rabbis, although Rabbi Lahlou supposedly came to Morocco during the First Temple Period.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Healing Traditions</strong> In the past, Moroccan Muslim families sought rabbis\' blessings to cure a host of conditions, including infertility, paralysis, and illness. Supplicants (usually women) would visit Jewish shrines in nearby villages, where they would attach a piece of cloth representing their wish to a tree or plant near the shrine and leave some candles or coins.<sup>2</sup> In some places, this tradition continues to this day, including at the Shrine of the Three Rabbis. Piles of clothes, chains, or hair can be found by the tombs, and a visitor to the cemetery in 2008 noted that the tree next to Rabbi Moul Sedra\'s tomb was dressed with a wide variety of women\'s clothing.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Morocco</strong> By the late 1200s, the Jews of Morocco gained the ruling Berber dynasty\'s permission to openly practice Judaism. Morocco became a haven for Jews fleeing persecution in Spain; as many as twenty thousand Jews arrived in Morocco in 1492 after being expelled from Spain.<sup>4</sup> By the seventeenth century, Jews lived in more than 250 communities in Morocco; Jewish traders were everywhere in the countryside, providing a connection between the costal cities and the smaller communities of the Sahara.<sup>5</sup> During Spain\'s occupation of Tetouan in the early 1860s, many Jews fled from port cities to the countryside or even to Algeria. When the Cr&eacute;miuex Decree of 1870 granted French citizenship to Algerian Jews, many Moroccan Jews settled in Algeria. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Morocco had the largest Jewish population of any Arab country, numbering between 110,000 and 120,000 people (about 2.5 percent of the population) in 1912.<sup>6</sup> The population reached a peak of around 250,000 in the 1950s. Morocco gained independence in 1956, and a series of governmental decisions (including partially nationalizing the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle schools and temporarily forbidding postal relatiosn with Israel) made many Jews eager to emigrate. Once emigration policies were relaxed in 1962, more than 130,000 Jews left Morocco over the next thirty years, usually settling in Canada, France, or other Western European countries.<sup>7</sup> Today, Morocco\'s Jewish population is less than five thousand people, most of whom live in Casablanca.&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Boum, Aoumar.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>According to legend, a band of Jews fleeing the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem headed west, eventually arriving at this oasis, Ifrane d&rsquo;Anti-Atlas (Oufrane) in southern Morocco, at the foot of a sloping mountain along the edge of the Sahara desert. Having experienced the magnificent temple in Jerusalem, they are said to have created an independent Jewish realm and built a mini-temple of their own. That legendary building still stands as a testament to the 2,000 year-old Amazigh (Berber) Jewish culture that somehow flourished amidst the raw power of the desert. After the Jewish community left en masse in the 1950s, the synagogue was locked and began to decay &mdash; only to be restored in 1999. But the symbolic depiction of the Ten Commandments (evoking the original tablets stored in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Temple) that once sat above the Torah ark has mysteriously vanished.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The town of Oufrane (Caves in the local Berber dialect) lies at the edge of the Sahara on an ancient caravan trade route. For centuries, this was a major commercial center, with spices, gold, and even slaves passing through en route from points south in Africa north toward port cities. Jews supposedly once ran an independent realm in the area, headquartered in Oufrane. After the Muslim conquest, Jews lived under the rule and personal protection of the local Tazeroualt dynasty. Oufrane&rsquo;s Jewish community once numbered in the hundreds, with many running successful businesses. But the caravan trade long ago dried up and in 1958 almost the entire Jewish community migrated north or to Israel.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Now a small regional market, the town is a shell of its former glory and its ancient Jewish quarter lies partially in ruins. Reaching the synagogue in this palm tree oasis is a journey back in time, with the narrow access road winding past women washing laundry in the waterways and age-old irrigation systems. The synagogue, situated at the bottom of the mountain&rsquo;s slope, is attended to by a guardian, who lives next door and is building a guesthouse for Jewish visitors.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/y79GMRknzis" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Ifrane d\'Anti-Atlas (Oufrane) Synagogue 2008</strong></em></p><p><strong>School:</strong> For centuries, Jews from southern Morocco have been drawn here to visit the ancient cemetery, located one kilometer away on the other side of a small mountain. On the holiday of Lag Ba&rsquo;Omer, the synagogue would host many of these pilgrims. In the 1940s and 1950s, the synagogue also housed a small school run by the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle, which sometimes held classes for the two dozen young pupils in the courtyard outside the synagogue entrance.</p><p><strong>Origins:</strong> The exact age of the synagogue is unclear, with some dating its origins to the 1620s and others to over 1,800 years ago. Its structure represents a classic Berber Jewish format, with interior benches along the walls (which feature small windows and slots for candles) and an elevated central platform for the service leader illuminated by an overhead thatch skylight. Photographs of the synagogue from the 1950s reveal a Torah ark covered by a suspended cloth and featuring a crown model of the Ten Commandments.</p><p><strong>Restoration:</strong> By the 1990s, the synagogue has begun to decay substantially. A grant from the European Union enabled the Casablanca Museum of Moroccan Jewish Heritage to restore the structure as a tourist spot. But the crown model of the Ten Commandments has vanished &ndash; and so the space over the ancient Torah arks sits empty, perhaps a fitting monument to the ancient Jewish community that has similarly disappeared from Oufrane.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br>  No sources have been provided. </p>            <p><font color="#999999">© Digital Heritage Mapping, Inc.</font></p>',

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p><strong>The Ozar Hatorah School:</strong></p><p>The Ozar Hatorah School network was established by three Syrian Jewish businessmen: Isaac Shalom from New York City, Joseph Shamah from Jerusalem, and Ezra Teubal from Buenos Aires (1). After Isaac Shalom and his wife visited Israel and the Middle East in 1934, they were shocked at what they perceived to be an utter lack of religious Jewish life (2). The secularization of the Jewish identity and spirituality coupled with a decline of intellectualism sparked Shalom to establish schools in Israel, the Middle East, and North Africa, which would teach both religious and secular classes to Jewish communities (3). The organization was established in 1944, with the founders donating around $250,000 to schools in Israel. In partnership with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee the Ozar Hatorah opened the first school in Casablanca in 1947 (4).</p><p>The curriculum of the school was ultra-Orthodox, combining traditional religious education with secular, general education. The teachers at the school were graduates of a teacher-training yeshivot, a religious Jewish university in France that focused studying on Ashkenazi Orthodoxy (Eastern European) (5). However, sometimes teachers from the neighboring Alliance Israelite Universelle (AIU) schools were hired to teach French. Students at the school were mainly aged six to eighteen.</p><p>By 1970, Ozar Hatorah ran around 23 schools and one summer camp throughout Morocco (6).<br />In the 1990&rsquo;s the school was combined with a primary-secondary school, N&eacute;v&eacute; Chalom. The school still continues to run to this day, serving the small population of Jews that remain in Morocco (7).

Both were organizations that targeted impoverished and underrepresented Jewish communities providing education, protection, and care. The Ozar Hatorah organization was angry at what they perceived to be the secular and &ldquo;de-Judaizing&rdquo; system of education employed at the AIU. The AIU system, especially their emphasis on assimilation into French culture, was seen as a rejection of the Jewish identity (1). The curriculum of the two schools highlighted their different approaches toward engendering Jewish identity. The Ozar Hatorah School focused on students analyzing Talmud, as well as the Torah, alongside commentary by scholar Rashi, and texts of the Prophets and the Mishna. The AIU, on the other hand, focused on learning Hebrew with some work on Torah texts and the Misha, accompanied with commentary by Maimonides (2). Both schools taught dinim (Jewish religious law). Over the years, in part due to the relationship both organizations had with the Joint Distribution Committee, the two schools were able to coexist. The AIU and Ozar Hatorah worked together to compose and print material for their schools when Jewish books were no longer allowed to be imported from Israel or the United States (3). Problems did arise again in the 1960s and 1970s. As the Jewish population began to emigrate out of Morocco, the student population decreased, and a consolidation of the two school networks was proposed. However, Ozar Hatorah saw such a move as an &ldquo;AIU plot&rdquo; to destroy their schools, and refused to join with the AIU school (4).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(1) Laskier.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\'s Morocco bureau is located in an unassuming office building surrounded by hotels, down the street from a Starbucks and Kentucky Fried Chicken, in the country\'s most populated city: Casablanca.<sup>1</sup> While the buidling\'s facade may not get a passerby to stop, the JDC has provided unequivable support for the Jews of Moroocco and the local communities since its opening in 1946. With the majority of Morocco\'s Jews living in Casablanca, the JDC is a community resource and a connection to the Jews of the diaspora.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Casablanca:&nbsp;</strong>The office of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (the JDC or "The Joint") is located at 53 Boulevard d\'Anfa, Casablanca, Morocco, near other Jewish institutions. In Casablanca, the JDC provides funding for Ozar Hatorah and Alliance Israelite Universale schools and works with the Council of Jewish Communities, which is the umbrella organization that oversees all of Morocco\'s Jewish communities.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;In recent years, working in close partnership with local leadership, JDC helped establish and continues to support the extraordinary new Fred &amp; Velva Levine Community Residence, which provides independent living for needy elderly welfare clients in Casablanca. It is next door to the Jewish Home for the Aged, which provides a dignified and safe environment for 30 residents, with full medical and nursing care available&mdash;again with JDC&rsquo;s ongoing support.<sup>4</sup></p></p>            <p><p><strong>American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee:&nbsp;</strong>The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) is one of the oldest Jewish humanitarian organizations in modern times. Founded in 1914, the JDC\'s mission was to aid &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; people around the world and adhere to the tenet of Jews helping other Jews.<sup>5</sup> Located in over 70 countries, the JDC partners with the local communities to provide assistance for those in need, as well as a resource for Jews in the region.<sup>6</sup></p><p>In response to the onset of World War I and the devastation it wreaked on thousands of Jewish communities in war-torn regions, the newly-formed <br />American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee initiated massive relief projects in Palestine to sustain fragile communities and across Eastern <br />Europe to support communities devastated by the war.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The JDC has also worked on creating archives of social, cultural, political, and economic Jewish life for several Middle Eastern and North African countries for the years 1940 to 1977.<sup>8</sup></p><p><strong>JDC in Morocco:</strong>&nbsp;The JDC, located in Casablanca, was established in 1946. One of the JDC&rsquo;s first acts in Morocco was to aid refugees fleeing Nazi Europe for Tangier. The Casablanca office of the JDC functions on 4 main pillars: providing support for Morocco&rsquo;s poorest Jews; providing Jewish education for the youngest generations; improving community infrastructure and training programs for local leaders; and providing mobile outreach for Morocco&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;In 2016, the JDC began offering "intergenerational" trips for the purpose of providing an opportunity for families with adult children to engage in cross-cultural exchange in Morocco.<sup>10</sup></p><p><strong>Jews in Casablanca and Morocco:</strong>&nbsp; In 1948, it was estimated that 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Of the 32.5 million people living in Morocco today, only an estimated 4,000 to 4,500 are Jewish, the majority living in Casablanca. Although the Jews of Morocco can date their presence throughout the country to the Carthaginian Period (over 2,500 years ago), the two largest waves of immigration occured first, after the fall of the Second Temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE; and second, in the 15th century, during the time of the Inquisition and the <em>Reconquista</em> in Spain.</p><p>Places in Morocco where vibrant Jewish communities used to be located now have little to no Jews left, from the Atlas Mountains to Marrakesh. However, trips such as the ones the JDC operates give Jews living the diaspora, from the United States to Israel, a chance to reconnect with their Moroccan heritage. Casablanca has the largest population of Jews in Morocco, the closest resembling an interconnected, vibrant community: it has six day schools, 18 kosher butchers, and 28 synagogues.<sup>11</sup> Though most Jews left since the creation of the state of Israel and following the revolution in 1956, the JDC still provides crucial support to the Jews in Morocco, as well as the local communities through partnerships with other Jewish institutions in Morocco and local non-governmental organizations.<sup>12<br /></sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Bibliography:</p><p>[1] World Atlas.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>A visitor walks into the New Jewish Cemetery of Tangier to find an unruly, unkept piece of land housing the graves of Jewish people dating back to the 1950s. The sight of the ignored cemetery is angering and frustrating: the local government has clearly neglected this area, which is one of the only two Jewish cemeteries in all of Tangier, a port city in the North African country of Morocco. Thanks to an urgent campaign by diasporic Jews living in Canada whom were enraged at the state of the cemetery, the cemetery has been cleaned up in recent years. Although a visitor can now walk through the cemetery without encountering weeds, snakes, or people living in the cemetery,<sup>1</sup> the Jews with ties to Tangier are still concerned about the future of this piece of land. Several Jews fear that the cemetery will just fall back into disrepair once more, or worse - taken over by local government due to its enticing location close to the ports of Tangier and destroyed as a burial ground. In 2010, the oldest Jewish hospital in Morocco was demolished, which only heightened the fears of the Jews leading the campaign. Since 1956 - the last largest wave of Jewish emmigration from Morocco - Jews\' relationship to the crown has not been as strong as it had been pre-revolution. Though several kings, such as Muhommad V, have been credited with encouraging and maintaining positive relations with the Jews of Morocco, advocacy for Maghrebi Jews has deteriorated as anti-semetism has increased in the last 50+ years.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>The New Jewish Cemetery:&nbsp;</strong>The Cimetiere Israelite Route de Rabat - Tanger, otherwise known as the &ldquo;New Jewish Cemetery,&rdquo; is one of two Jewish cemeteries located in Tangier, Morocco<sup>3</sup>; the cemetery is located on the highway heading to Rabat, on the outskirts of the city.<sup>4</sup> Tangier, located only about 9 miles south of Spain, situated on the northern coast of Morocco along the Mediterranean Sea, has seen influences from the Spanish, the French, and the Moors. In the Western World, it is perhaps most well-known as the home to several artists of the Beat Generation; most famously William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, and Peter Bowles.<sup>5</sup> The writers of the Beat Generation made Tangier their home while it was an international territory<sup>6</sup> and created a reputation for Tangier as an expatriate city of leisure and hashish.</p><p><strong>Jews in Morocco:&nbsp;</strong>The Jewish communities of Morocco largely arrived in two major waves: the first, at the time of the fall of the second temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE and the second, during the Inquisition of the 15th century and the Reconquista of 1492 in Spain; the Jews of Morocco that came from the Iberian Peninsula identify as Sephardic. Mass emigration of Jews from Morocco also occurred in two waves: the first in 1948, with the creation of the state of Israel, and the second in 1956 with the revolution against the French in Morocco and the creation of the independent state. Today, there are only approximately 150 Jews left in the city of Tangier.<sup>7</sup></p></p>            <p><p><strong>New Cemetery:</strong> The Cimetiere Israelite of Tanger is located on the Rue de Rabat, next to the Beit Hahayim Synagogue.<sup>8</sup> First-hand accounts note that in recent years, the cemetery has not been maintained properly, with weeds, bushes, and animals roaming about the graves.<sup>9</sup> Jewish communities in Toronto, Canada were particularly concerned, as the Benchimol Hospital - the oldest Jewish hospital in Morocco<sup>10</sup> - had been demolished in 2010 and were worried that the cemetery was next. These communities called upon Moroccan officials to protect Jewish sites in Morocco, and in response, the cemetery was cleaned up.<sup>11</sup></p><p><strong>Old Cemetery:</strong> The old cemetery, &ldquo;Cimetiere Juif de Tanger&rdquo; is also located on the fringe of the city on the outside of the medina walls<sup>12</sup> and was operational before 1910.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Located atop a cliff, the cemetery signals a community rooted in the history of the city with graves written in Hebrew and Spanish.<sup>14</sup> First-hand sources say that some of the graves date back to the beginnings of the Jewish community in Tangier, while others belong to luminaries of the local community. As with the new cemetery, concerns over the upkeep of the cemetery are at the forefront of Jews in Tangier, as well as the diasporic Jewish-Moroccan community. In particular, some communities are concerned that the cemetery, near the port of Tangier, will be taken over by Moroccan authorities and the graves removed.<sup>15</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Bibliography:</p><p>[1] Jewish Maghrib Jukebox.

      excerpt: 'school',
      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Once operating out of a small, &ldquo;dilapidated&rdquo; canteen, the Em Habanim (Habbanim) school in Casablanca, Morocco became a center of Jewish congregation by the late 1950s (1). By the 1960s, the school stood as a two-story building on 270 square meters of land, across from a charming synagogue, which welcomed the greater Jewish community (2). Despite the increase in space, Em Habanim was always bustling, filled with the voices of young boys, playing and learning. The Em Habanim school was part of the Ozar/Osar Hatorah system, with a Jewish orthodox curriculum that included instruction in Hebrew, Arabic, and French (3). Before the final mass emigration of Jews from Morocco following its independence in 1956, the Em Habanim school in Casablanca accommodated a total of 9 instructors and 346 students (4). Em Habanim was a school for boys, primarily meant to help disadvantaged youth access quality education and religious enrichment. Entering students were at least 6 years of age, and the length of instruction was 7 years total (5). The school in Casablanca still exists today, is no longer gender-segregated (due to the limited number of Jewish pupils in Morocco), and is still connected to the remaining Jewish Moroccan community through the endearing synagogue attached.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Em Habanim:</strong> &lsquo;Em Habanim&rsquo; in Arabic, translates to &ldquo;Mother of the boys.&rdquo; In fact, a group of Moroccan Jewish women and mothers started a network of schools and orphanages throughout Morocco, specifically in the mellah of Sefrou, under the title of &lsquo;Em Habanim&rsquo; in the early 20th century (6). Although this is not the same network to which the Em Habanim school in Casablanca belongs, the values of educating and caring for young Jewish children in Morocco is consistent.</p><p>The Em Habanim school in Casablanca was founded in 1942--a difficult time for world Jewry. The founders were brothers, Moise and David Bendayan (7). The point of the school was, that no matter what the circumstances, children of varying levels of privilege were to be educated, immersed in religion, and provided with the necessary space and materials to practice their religion properly (8).&nbsp;The Em Habanim school received grants from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC or JOINT), a Jewish support and assistance organization based out of New York City. The JDC was founded in 1914, and supported many networks of Jewish education, including the Alliance Israelite Universelle (AIU) (9).</p><p><strong>Ozar Hatorah:</strong> The Em Habanim school is part of a network of Ozar Hatorah schools throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Ozar Hatorah is a non-profit organization created in 1945 by a New Yorker of Syrian decent, named Isaac Shalom (10). The grand concern that brought Shalom and his partners to create the organization was what they saw as a threatening, &ldquo;Jewish spiritual decline and intellectual impoverishment&rdquo; (11).<br />In total, there were three Ozar Hatorah-affiliated Em Habanim schools in Morocco in the 1950s: Casablanca, Fez, and Sefrou. Incidentally, Ozar Hatorah means, &ldquo;the wealth of the torah,&rdquo; and is a strongly religious organization. Ozar Hatorah affiliated schools, like Em Habanim, are often Jewish Orthodox, and take pride in religious excellence. This tenet came into tension when Ozar Hatorah schools had to coexist, and even share funding and other resources with more secular Jewish educational institutions, such as the AIU (12). Although the tension between the differently-minded institutions was quite real, Ozar Hatorah schools often supplemented their French instruction with AIU-trained teachers (13). Overall, the two institutions had different ways of educating, but shared the drive to improve the lives of Jewish Moroccan children and families.</p><p><strong>Em Habanim in North Hollywood:</strong> The Em Habanim school network has emigrated to the US along with many Sephardic Jews of Morocco and of Moroccan descent.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>&lsquo;Ain Benimatthar, once known by its French name, Berguent, has a small Jewish cemetery. The cemetery is not far from a Vichy Camp where Jews were imprisoned during the Holocaust, near the abandoned railroad tracks of Ain Benimattar.&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Park near the abandoned train tracks of Ain Benimatthar, cross them, and walk toward a walled enclosure at the base of a barren mountain. The cemetery walls are made of dusty, tan bricks, in the process of crumbling into dustto the earth. Inside, only a few graves remain intact, while the rest are scattered about in the form of holes, broken tomb stones, interspersed with the remains of burned trash and abandoned clothing. One intact tombstone bears a French inscription dating from 1939 and another from the 1960s. The rest are so worn and decrepit that they are illegible. You may find children playing in the Jewish cemetery, in absence of a playground.</p><p><strong>Internment Camps of WWII:</strong>&nbsp;During World War II, Germany, Italy, and Vichy France interned thousands of Jews in the territories they controlled in North Africa. As of 2006, the sites of 110 forced labor camps for Jews have been identified in Morocco (30), Algeria (37), Tunisia (37), and Libya(6). In eastern Morocco and western Algeria, the Vichy French government interned approximately 2,000 Jewish men, many of whom had been serving in the Foreign Legion or the French army, or were illegal residents of France. Many of these Jews had been deported from France to serve in harsh conditions as forced laborers on the construction of the Trans-Sahara railroad. Ain Benimattar, then known as&nbsp;Berguent, was an all-Jewish camp along the railroad.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Satloff, Robert. <em>Among the Righteous: Lost Stories from the Holocaust&rsquo;s Long Reach into Arab Lands</em> (New York: Public Affairs, 2006), 63-64.&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Nzj9AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec">http://books.google.com/books?id=Nzj9AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec</a>&nbsp;(accessed July 14, 2014).</p><p>Satloff, Robert.&nbsp;<em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>.

      title: 'Cemetery at Taznakht, Morocco',
      excerpt: 'cemetery',
      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The Jewish cemetery of Taznakht, an isolated town in the sparsely populated rocky landscape south of Ouarzazate, should have decayed into oblivion like many of the remote cemeteries in southern Morocco. Indeed, after Taznakht&rsquo;s Jewish community left in the 1950s, the cemetery walls began to crumble and tombs began to disintegrate from exposure to the elements and vandalism. But then, in 2005, Charly Bouskila, a Casablanca businessman with roots in Taznakht, decided he had to act to save the burial site of his ancestors and preserve it for future generations. Three years later he inaugurated a gleaming new cemetery complex, with sturdy new walls, dozens of restored tombs, a synagogue, and even a guesthouse. As a result, remote Taznakht today hosts one of the best maintained Jewish cemeteries in all of North Africa.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Setting:</strong> Heading southwest from Ouarzazate, the highway is surrounded by a desolate rocky terrain. On the side of the road, a 1950s-style American gas station emerges on the horizon, a prop used for many of the movies filmed by the studios in Ouarzazate. About a half hour past the filling station, the town of Taznakht emerges from the desert landscape. Divided into eastern and western sections, the mellah (Jewish quarter) and Jewish cemetery lie partway toward the eastern half. Situated along a gently sloping hill, the cemetery lies several hundred yards east of the mellah. It is said to be more than 600 years old.</p><p><strong>Taznakht&rsquo;s Jews:</strong> The town served as a regional trade hub and is known for its carpets. For centuries Jews lived in the town. In 1954, Israeli academic Haim Zeev Hirschberg visited Taznakht and described 42 local Jewish families, comprising about 300 people (see his Hebrew book Me-Eretz Mevo ha-Shemesh). The community, according to Hirschberg, was economically successful in a range of professions yet soon planned to make aliyah to Israel en masse. The locals claimed to live in relative safety, with only one member of the community murdered by a Muslim within living memory. The mellah apparently had two synagogues, joined by a common wall, with the older synagogue featuring illustrations of a shofar, lulav, etrog, and traditional Berber stylings.</p><p><strong>Sepher Tislit:</strong> Legendary saints buried in the cemetery include Aharon Hacohen, Ait El-Cohen, Isso Ibgui, Lalla Simha Ruben, and Moshe Wizeman. But the town&rsquo;s real claim to fame was Sepher Tislit. The Torah scroll of Tislit by tradition a Torah from Jerusalem stored in the old synagogue that itself received pilgrims at an annual hiloula. The scroll was known to have performed many miracles and was also venerated by local Muslims, with some even kissing the wall of the old synagogue for good luck. The community brought the scroll to Israel and it currently resides in a synagogue in Ashkelon, still receiving pilgrims at its annual hiloula.</p><p><strong>Decay:</strong> Once the Jewish community left, the cemetery was largely abandoned. Tombs faded and crumbled from the wind, rain, and sun. Local Berber women would smash gravestones as part of a superstitious fertility ritual. The tombs risked disintegrating completely and being absorbed into anonymity by the rocky surroundings.</p><p><strong>Charly Bouskila:</strong> In the nick of time, a son of Taznakht returned to rescue his patrimony. Charly&rsquo;s grandfather, Rabbi Shimon Bouskila, was the butcher and mohel (circumciser) for the region. His father Yaakov, after leaving Taznakht, worked as a religious scholar in Casablanca and transformed his home into a house of study. In 2005, Charly visited Taznakht and was shocked to discover the Jewish cemetery lying in ruins due to serious acts of vandalism. Inspired by his father&rsquo;s long-time vision to preserve the cemetery, Charly resolved to take on the challenge.</p><p><strong>Restoration:</strong> On June 2, 2008, Charly Bouskila hosted a large crowd for the rededication of the cemetery. The elderly Rabbi David Bouskila, a native of the town, was in attendance along with the rabbi of Marrakesh and the governor of Ouarzazate. Participants at the celebration found a cemetery transformed. Replacing the cracked tombstones and crumbling structures were symmetrical white-washed tombs, with gravestones re-assembled and a high wall enclosing them. Bouskila also built a synagogue hall and a guest-house, which includes a full bathroom and basic kitchen. Over the tomb of his grandfather Shimon, he constructed a small concrete canopy. A website, called &ldquo;Zehout Avot,&rdquo; meaning merit of the fathers, documents the remarkable construction and re-construction effort.</p><p><strong>Visiting:</strong> With a guardian on the premises 24 hours a day, visitors are welcome to the cemetery. Bouskila even encourages visitors to take advantage of the bathrooms and kitchen for extended stays. He is in the process of collecting as much information as he can from relatives of those buried in the cemetery. &ldquo;What a mitvzah [good deed] it is to honor the memory of our fathers!&rdquo; he observes. Some visitors question whether the cemetery&rsquo;s transformation is fully appropriate, as the site looks more modern than an authentic restoration of the past. Others marvel at the beautiful complex and the amenities that make it possible for pilgrims coming from afar to enjoy the site. In any case, Charly Bouskila has helped create a unique Jewish heritage site in southern Morocco one that now has the potential to endure more than 600 years into the future.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Yossef Chetrit.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>This cemetery outside the small town of Joarf does not have any markings to distinguish it as Jewish, and not much more to confirm it is a cemetery; there is only a scattering of rocks.&nbsp;As is common throughout southern Morocco, however, amidst the rocks are women&rsquo;s undergarments and broken pottery&mdash;the tell-tale signs of Amazigh (Berber) women&rsquo;s ritual ablutions that only occur at Jewish burial sites. This tradition is all that testifies to the Jews buried in this desolate landscape.&nbsp; No sources found for original summary. (8/2014)</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Morocco</strong> By the late 1200s, the Jews of Morocco gained the ruling Berber dynasty\'s permission to openly practice Judaism. Morocco became a haven for Jews fleeing persecution in Spain; as many as twenty thousand Jews arrived in Morocco in 1492 after being expelled from Spain.<sup>1</sup> By the seventeenth century, Jews lived in more than 250 communities in Morocco; Jewish traders were everywhere in the countryside, providing a connection between the costal cities and the smaller communities of the Sahara.<sup>2</sup> During Spain\'s occupation of Tetouan in the early 1860s, many Jews fled from port cities to the countryside or even to Algeria. When the Cr&eacute;miuex Decree of 1870 granted French citizenship to Algerian Jews, many Moroccan Jews settled in Algeria. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Morocco had the largest Jewish population of any Arab country, numbering between 110,000 and 120,000 people (about 2.5 percent of the population) in 1912.<sup>3</sup> The population reached a peak of around 250,000 in the 1950s. Morocco gained independence in 1956, and a series of governmental decisions (including partially nationalizing the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle schools and temporarily forbidding postal relatiosn with Israel) made many Jews eager to emigrate.<sup>4</sup> Once emigration policies were relaxed in 1962, more than 130,000 Jews left Morocco over the next thirty years, usually settling in Canada, France, or other Western European countries. Today, Morocco\'s Jewish population is less than five thousand people, most of whom live in Casablanca.<sup>5</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Hatimi, Mohammed. <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The Sylvain Levi school was named in honor of the noted French historian and orientalist and president of the Alliance Israelite Universelle.[1]&nbsp; After facing initial challenges--from without (tribal unrest) and within (opposition to female education)--the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle opened a school for boys in 1883, to be followed by a girls school 16 years later, in 1899. Combined enrollment gradually increased from several hundred students each year to over 2,000 by the early 1950s.&nbsp;The last AIU school in Fez closed in 1989 [2].</p></p>            <p><p>Throughout the medieval period, Fez was home to the largest Jewish community of the Maghreb. Although Fez Westernized throughout the twentieth century, it remained an important center of Judaism. While Fez had a substantial Jewish community of 18,020 in 1948, a large portion of the Jewish population emigrated to Israel--reducing the number of Jews in Fez to 13,111 by 1951.

After facing initial challenges--from without (tribal unrest) and within (opposition to female education)--the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle opened a boys school in Fez in 1883, under the supervision of Salomon Benoliel [2]. The AIU first founded schools in the "mellah" (Jewish quarter), including the boys school and then a girls school in 1899, but also founded a coeducational school in the new city in 1934. The AIU Boys School\'s enrollment gradually increased from several hundred students each year to over 2,000 by the early 1950s. The last AIU school in Fez closed in 1989 [3].</p></p>            <p><p>Throughout the medieval period, Fez was home to the largest Jewish community of the Maghreb.

This first school served only fifteen students, and closed after one year. However, in 1907 boys and girls schools served 148 and 66 students, respectively, and in 1936 the AIU served 787 students. Yet, in 1951 enrollment dropped to 673.

The Safi Jewish community played an important role in commerce and the town\'s community through the mid-twentieth century, especially as merchants, financiers, physicians, and scholars. Until the mass exodus of Jews from North Africa during the twentieth century, the Jews of Safi primarily lived in the "mellah" (Jewish quarter) which was located just north of the town\'s "medina" (old city) [2].</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Thomas Park, "Safi (Asfi)," <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>,&nbsp;Executive Editor Norman A.

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The Rabbi Meir Toledano Synagogue, one of the few remaining synagogues in Meknes, Morocco, may date back as early as the 13th century. According to tradition, Meknes&rsquo;s Mahrit synagogue was built in the 1200s, and destroyed by an earthquake in 1630.<sup>1</sup> The Toledano family rebuilt it when they arrived in Meknes. The synagogue may be named for one of the lesser-known scions of the famous family: Rabbi Meir Toledano, best known for editing and publishing his father-in-law Moses ben Daniel&rsquo;s works on the Torah as <em>Melekhet ha-Kodesh</em> in 1803.<sup>2</sup></p></p>            <p><p><strong>Meknes</strong>&nbsp;The distinguished history of Meknes&rsquo;s Jewish community dates to the reign of Sultan Mawlay Isma&rsquo;il, who made Meknes his capital in 1675. As part of a huge construction project to expand the city, a Jewish quarter was constructed in 1679, becoming the third mellah in Morocco after Fez and Marrakesh.<sup>3</sup> Meknes became known for its many eminent Jewish scholars and religious leaders, including those of the Toledano dynasty. David ben Hassin, the most famous writer of liturgical poetry in 18th century Morocco, was born in Meknes.<sup>4</sup> The early twentieth century saw another era of prosperity for Meknes&rsquo;s Jews, who numbered 10,855 according to a 1936 census.<sup>5</sup> In 1912, the first year of the French occupation, Rabbi Ze&rsquo;ev Wolf Halperin came to Meknes from Britain and founded an advanced yeshiva for rabbinic training, as well as another for laymen. In the 1920s, a new mellah was constructed next to the old one, including several synagogues and a large Orthodox school that had a student body of twelve hundred by 1947.<sup>6</sup> In the 1960s, migration to Casablanca, Morocco&rsquo;s economic capital, or out of the country entirely reduced Meknes&rsquo;s Jewish population from between fifteen and eighteen thousand to less than eleven thousand. The numbers dropped precipitously over the next two decades: less than two hundred people lived in the mellah in the 1980s, although three synagogues continued to operate. As of 2007, the Jewish population of Meknes was between 125 and 250 people.<sup>7</sup></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>[1] Bentov, Haim, Haim J. Cohen, and Michael M.

Why, or how he knew this, is unclear. What is said is that he went into a cave to avoid capture, which succeeded perhaps too well. Not only did they not find him, but no one has ever found him. Three different tombs are in the shrine leaving the precise burial spot in doubt.</p><p><strong>Amram ben Diwan:&nbsp;</strong>Amram ben Diwan is one of the best-known saints in the pantheon of Moroccan Jewish holy men. According to tradition, he was a rabbinical emissary from Hebron, who arrived in Morocco with his son, Haim (alternate spelling: Ḥayyim), sometime in the 18th century and took up residence in Fez. When Haim fell gravely ill, Rabbi Amram prayed, offering his life for that of his son, who miraculously recovered. Shortly thereafter, while on a visit to Ouezzane to collect funds for the religious institutions in Hebron, he fell ill and died and was buried in the nearby cemetery of Asjen, which became a pilgrimage destination for Jews from all over Morocco. There is no cenotaph or gravestone marking the tomb, only a cairn of stones. One of the miracles attributed to the site is that all attempts to erect a monument have ended in failure.</p><p><strong>Hillula of Rabbi Amram:</strong> The ceremony commemorating the anniversary of Rabbi Amram&rsquo;s death, his hillula (the Hebrew word for wedding, so called because the saint is seen as having wed the Divine), takes place on the holiday of Lag B&rsquo;Omer, which falls thirty-three days after the beginning of Passover. It still draws large numbers of Moroccan Jews both from within the country and from abroad, including from Israel. A huge bonfire is lit directly on top of the pile of stones marking the grave, and people caught up in religious enthusiasm sometime jump through the flames. Miraculous cures are said to have taken place during the hillula. In Sefrou and Meknes, Jews who could not make the pilgrimage to Asjen invoked Rabbi Amram at local substitute shrines (a sacred cave in Sefrou and a cairn in the cemetery of Meknes). Muslims from the region also sometimes invoke the Jewish saint&rsquo;s aid in curing illness or infertility.</p><p><strong>Suggested Further Reading:</strong></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Stillman, Norman A. <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World.&nbsp;</em>s.v.&nbsp;"Amram ben Diwan."

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>In the remote High Atlas Mountains lies a lush hidden valley accessible only via a solitary, winding road. that winds through the mountains. The dramatic valley floor is punctuated by two pyramid-like mini-mountains, each capped by a round mud granary that surrounds the tomb of holy men: Sidi Moussa (Lord Moses) and Sidi Chitta (Lord Chitta) both Jews, according to local legend.&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Setting:</strong> The Ait Bougmez Valley is known as the happy valley, apparently reflecting the friendly disposition of its residents. Tucked away in a remote corner of the Atlas Mountains, Ait Bougmez sits in the shadow of the M&rsquo;goun Massif, the area\'s tallest peak. Well irrigated with streams fed by mountain snow, the green valley features a mosaic of green fields in geometric patterns. Small clusters of red clay homes dot the valley.</p><p><strong>Agadir:</strong> Due to its remote location, the valley was a part of Morocco known as Bled Siba, the countryside uncontrolled by the king\'s forces. The lack of a dominant power meant tribes often fought battled one another for power. Local villages would create a communal granary, or "agadir" in Tamazigh (the Berber language), to store supplies and to provide shelter in the event of a siege. To maximize security, the agadir would ideally be placed on a hilltop or peak with a panoramic view of the surroundings.</p><p><strong>Shrines:</strong> The shrines of Sidi Moussa and Sidi Chitta are classical examples of agadirs. Sidi Moussa sits on a conical hill above a village called Tabant. A few miles away, atop a parallel hill, stands the Sidi Chitta agadir. The buildings, divided into small rooms where local families store their grain, are squat, circular structures with four stone turrets offering strategic look-out spots. Inside, a spiral staircase leads to the upper floors and roof.</p><p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Today, the Ait Bougmez Valley does not see inter-tribal conflict, and so the Sidi Moussa shrine has been turned into a cultural museum spotlighting the valley&rsquo;&rsquo;s traditional folk-craft. The shrine\'s guardian, who claims he is 120 years old, climbs the hill every morning to administer the small museum and offer visitors tea.</p><p><strong>Jewish Roots:</strong> Little is known about the two saints, who are remembered as pious men with remarkable healing powers. Many locals, particularly older residents of the valley, share the legend that the men were rabbis.

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Tucked away in the middle of nowhere, miles from any main roads, the shrine complex of the rabbi known as Moulay Ighi (&ldquo;Master of Ighi&rdquo;) sits perched on a hilltop amidst the grandeur of the Atlas Mountains. For centuries, Jews (as well as Muslims) from all over Morocco would converge here on foot and on mules to visit the rabbi&rsquo;&rsquo;s tomb and pray for his intervention in their lives. The remote shrine is considered one of the most popular in the country, and by some accounts thousands of people would arrive for the annual hiloula (pilgrimage) to the grave on the holiday of Lag b&rsquo;Omer. Today the shrine is still visited by pilgrims (though in smaller numbers), who can now stay in new guesthouses and even enjoy a modern synagogue on the premises.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>The Setting:</strong> Tourists and commuters speeding on the mountain pass between Marrakesh and Ouarzazate can easily miss the sharp turn off to the village of Zekarten in the valley below. But the adventurous traveler who makes the turn descends down into a largely unpopulated area of the Atlas Mmountains where a narrow road connects the sparse villages. In this valley, rural life for the local Amazigh (Berber) population appears to have changed little in the past few hundred years, with women in traditional dress washing laundry in them flowing water and men carrying supplies to their homes. After winding along the river for about 10km, another sharp turn by a small waterfall leads up to the top of hill. Towards the top, an archway marks the formal entrance to the shrine complex of Moulay Ighi. The complex, which mostly painted in terra cotta hues, includes a shrine for the rabbi, plus a small cemetery, synagogue, and guest houses. Originally the rabbi&rsquo;&rsquo;s grave was open to the elements. The covered mausoleum surrounding the tomb was built in 1990 by Albert Soussan in memory of his father.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/13cuCHsFURI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Shrine of Moulay Ighi&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Saint:</strong> One of the most Arguably among the top ten most popular Jewish saints in Morocco, little factual evidence exists about Moulay Ighi. He is believed to be Rabbi David Laskar, who by legend came from Israel on a fundraising mission for religious academies in the Holy Land. A plaque inside the shrine claims Laskar died on August 22, 1717. Laskar was supposedly visiting the village of Zekarten, about 5 miles away, on his fundraising journey. He suddenly sensed his own death looming, and asked the local burial society members to follow him several kilometers to the hill. As the locals dug a grave at his request, he ritually cleansed himself in the river at the foot of the hill. He then ascended to the gravesite and commanded the earth to close around him. For people in the north who do not have the means or time to travel all the way to Ighi, there is a grave marker in the old Casablanca Jewish cemetery commemorating Rabbi Laskar.</p><p><strong>The Pilgrimage:</strong> Hundreds and even thousands of Jews would descend upon the site during pilgrimages throughout the year, including on the holiday of Sukkot. Many would camp out around the site for several days, lighting candles by the saint&rsquo;&rsquo;s grave. In fact, Moulay Ighi is also known as Mul Shejra El-Khedra (&ldquo;Master of the Green Tree&rdquo;) after a bush near his grave that never caught fire despite the hundreds if candles lit by pilgrims. This plant was apparently myrtle (&ldquo;imtik&rdquo; in Moroccan Arabic) and shaded the stone marking the rabbi&rsquo;&rsquo;s grave. It was a common tradition to take a ritual bath in the river below the hill before ascending to the saint&rsquo;&rsquo;s shrine. The saint has a reputation for being able to help to cure barren women. In the 20th century, the site was run by Shlomo Bouskila, who is now buried in the small cemetery outside the saint&rsquo;&rsquo;s covered shrine. A new synagogue has been built on the site in memory of Shlomo and his wife Esther. Members of the Bouskila family today continue to administer the site, which is guarded daily by a Muslim caretaker. The shrine is venerated by Muslims as well, and local Muslim leaders have been known to attend the hiloula. There is even a legend that a former Muslim caretaker of the shrine had no sheep for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha (when it is customary to slaughter a lamb), but after appealing to the rabbi for help, he soon met a mysterious man on the road who gave him a sheep as a gift.</p><p><strong>The Isolation:</strong> Some scholars debate the significance of the remote location of the saint&rsquo;&rsquo;s tomb, which is not convenient from to any major population center. One interesting theory posits that the more remote the shrine, the more followers could show their devotion by going to great lengths to commune with the saint. As the scholar observes, &ldquo;inconveniences caused by the saint&rsquo;&rsquo;s geographical surroundings undoubtedly intensify the pilgrim&rsquo;&rsquo;s sense of purpose.&rdquo;</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>"Shrine of Moulay Ighi."

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Leaving Marrakesh heading southeast on the road to Ouarzazate, about 20 minutes into the drive, a faded whitewashed wall on the right side of the road appears with a cryptic spray-painted message: &ldquo;Rabbi Habib.&rdquo; The sign is half hidden behind an electric pole as well as by the regular traffic of donkeys that pass through the local village of Ait Ourir. The blue spray paint is a sign for pilgrims to turn off the paved highway and venture up a dirt road into the Atlas Mountains toward the grave of an esteemed rabbi.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Rabbi El-Mizrahi:</strong> The winding road ends in front of a three-story complex that houses the shrine of Rabbi Habib El-Mizrahi (Habib the Easterner). By legend, the rabbi came from Israel many centuries ago as an emissary to the local population. Muslims, who also venerate the rabbi&rsquo;s tomb, call him Mulay Tadot, the Master of the Acacia, after a tree that grows by the tomb.</p><p><strong>Remote:</strong> For centuries the shrine was just a small hut. By some accounts, few visitors made the trek up the mountain to visit the tomb, which was tucked into the slope and had no formal marble tombstone. A Muslim man who lived nearby took care of the tomb and would bring water to those Jews who would ascend the mountain after shopping at the Tuesday market in the village below. &rdquo;What bad luck I have that the Jews don&rsquo;t come to this saint,&rdquo; the guardian is quoted as saying, &ldquo;Otherwise I would be rich like the other pqidim [Muslim guardians]!&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Restoration:</strong> In recent years, however, David Ohayon, a member of the Marrakesh Jewish community, built a large terra cotta complex around the grave, providing guest rooms, full bathrooms, and a plaza to host the many pilgrims who visit the shrine for the rabbi&rsquo;s hiloula &ndash; typically celebrated on the holiday Lag b&rsquo;Omer. The regional governor even comes to welcome pilgrims, some of whom stay for an entire week.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uZBBSyJnOP4" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Shrine of Habib Mizrahi&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cemetery:</strong> An old cemetery was recently discovered on the hill next to the shrine. A particularly heavy rainy season caused mudslides on the hill, revealing dozens of Jewish graves that had been obscured underneath layers of dirt and forgotten. The site is believed to be hundreds of years old. Many of the old graves have been restored by David Ohayon, and now have been outfitted with a slot on the end for placing memorial candles. It is believed that many more graves remain on the hill underneath mud &mdash; burial sites themselves buried by the earth.</p><p><strong>Complex:</strong> Rabbi El-Mizrahi&rsquo;s grave is located on the first floor of the complex, with a photograph of Morocco&rsquo;s king hanging over the entrance from the courtyard. About two dozen rooms fill out the remainder of the complex, including small bedrooms, larger common spaces with couches, and bathrooms with showers. The roof deck offers a stunning view of the surrounding hills.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>"Shrine of Habib Mizrahi."

      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Legend has it that this oasis derives its name from the nomadic Jews who once roamed the mountains above. Some of these Jews may have settled in the nearby date farming village of Tioute, whose mellah (Jewish Quarter) now lies in rubble. The tomb of the Hacham of Tioute, a saint, is also nearby.&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Tioute</strong> Located in southern Morocco, Tioute is a community of roughly 2,800 people. The village is surrounded by farms, both subsistence (growing mostly dates) and commercial (with cash crops such as oranges, bananas, and maize). Nearby in the Anti Atlas mountains, a beautiful kasbah sits at the top of one of the smallest mountains. A painted staircase leads down the mountain to the village; halfway down the staircase, a short path leads to the tomb of a local saint, the Hacham of Tioute.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Morocco</strong> By the late 1200s, the Jews of Morocco gained the ruling Berber dynasty\'s permission to openly practice Judaism. Morocco became a haven for Jews fleeing persecution in Spain; as many as twenty thousand Jews arrived in Morocco in 1492 after being expelled from Spain. By the seventeenth century, Jews lived in more than 250 communities in Morocco; Jewish traders were everywhere in the countryside, providing a connection between the costal cities and the smaller communities of the Sahara. During Spain\'s occupation of Tetouan in the early 1860s, many Jews fled from port cities to the countryside or even to Algeria. When the Cr&eacute;miuex Decree of 1870 granted French citizenship to Algerian Jews, many Moroccan Jews settled in Algeria. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Morocco had the largest Jewish population of any Arab country, numbering between 110,000 and 120,000 people (about 2.5 percent of the population) in 1912. The population reached a peak of around 250,000 in the 1950s. Morocco gained independence in 1956, and a series of governmental decisions (including partially nationalizing the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle schools and temporarily forbidding postal relatiosn with Israel) made many Jews eager to emigrate. Once emigration policies were relaxed in 1962, more than 130,000 Jews left Morocco over the next thirty years, usually settling in Canada, France, or other Western European countries. Today, Morocco\'s Jewish population is less than five thousand people, most of whom live in Casablanca.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Hatimi, Mohammed. <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>.

      excerpt: 'synagogue',
      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The unforgiving desert heat compelled the builders of this old synagogue in the K&rsquo;sar (fortress) of Gulaine (Ouirlane) to allow precious few openings to the outside world. Worshipers were thus shielded from the elements, particularly the sun, while drawing reading light was drawn from two skylights, one above the entrance and the other above the Torah cabinet, which was built into a side wall. The synagogue is now used to store hay. Its nondescript entrance is concealed by the covered, maze-like streets of the mellah (Jewish quarter).</p></p>            <p><p><strong>The Ouirlane Mellah</strong>&nbsp;The Jewish community left Ouirlane in the 1950s and 1960s. These days the mellah of Ouirlane lies abandoned and in ruins. While the synagogue remains mostly intact, many of the other buildings are missing entire walls, and the usual entrance to the mellah is broken. Although no one lives in the mellah, it still sees occasionaly visitors, and the synagogue is now used to store hay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mellahs</strong> Mellahs were specifically Jewish residential quarters established by law or custom in many communities of the Islamic world. The Moroccan term, mallah, originated from the name of the salt marsh in Fez where the first quarter was established in 1438. The name entered common usage as similar quarters were created in Marrakesh in the 16th century, Meknes in the 17th century, and many coastal towns in the early 19th century. The mellahs had practical benefits for the local authorities: having the entire Jewish community of a city located in one area made it easier to evaluate taxes and royal protection. While it was usual for Jews to be officially required to live in the mellah, there were exceptions: in Essaouira, wealthy Jews could move out of the mellah, and towns such as Tangier and Safi never established walled mellahs at all. Despite the walls, interactions between the Jewish and Muslim communities were frequent and occurred throughout the city. The physical segregation of Jews was eventually outlawed by the French colonial government.</p><p><strong>Morocco</strong> By the late 1200s, the Jews of Morocco gained the ruling Berber dynasty\'s permission to openly practice Judaism. Morocco became a haven for Jews fleeing persecution in Spain; as many as twenty thousand Jews arrived in Morocco in 1492 after being expelled from Spain.

He recounts how and when they left, and offers a surprising reason for why.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TUom5cu6-Fk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Amizmiz Mellah and Cemetery</em></strong></p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>"Amizmiz Mellah and Cemetery," Youtube video, 9:31, posted by DiarnaInfo, June 10, 2010.&nbsp;</p></p>            <p><font color="#999999">© Digital Heritage Mapping, Inc.</font></p>',

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>The mellah of Ait Ferakh has been abandoned since the 1960s, when the Jewish population of the town emigrated. The buildings are now crumbling into ruins, although the outer walls of the synagogue still stand. The Jewish cemetery can still be seen outside the city, but no gravestones remain intact.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Mellah&nbsp;</strong>Mellahs were specifically Jewish residential quarters established by law or custom in many communities of the Islamic world. The Moroccan term, mallah, originated from the name of the salt marsh in Fez where the first quarter was established in 1438. The name entered common usage as similar quarters were created in Marrakesh in the 16th century, Meknes in the 17th century, and many coastal towns in the early 19th century. The mellahs had practical benefits for the local authorities: having the entire Jewish community of a city located in one area made it easier to evaluate taxes and royal protection. While it was usual for Jews to be officially required to live in the mellah, there were exceptions: in Essaouira, wealthy Jews could move out of the mellah, and towns such as Tangier and Safi never established walled mellahs at all. Despite the walls, interactions between the Jewish and Muslim communities were frequent and occurred throughout the city. The physical segregation of Jews was eventually outlawed by the French colonial government.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>Gottreich, Emily. <em>Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World</em>. &ldquo;Mallāh.&rdquo; Brill Online, 2014.

A caretaker watches over the Taroudant Cemetery and guides visitors around the tombs and graves. Although few of the visible graves are inscribed in Hebrew, the most famous grave in this cemetery is for the Jewish saint David Ben Baruk Cohen Azog.</p></p>            <p><p>The Jewish community in Taroudant (also Tarudant) may have existed as early as the eleventh century. Located at a crossroads, Taroudant\'s history and economy was influenced by the sugar industry and trans-Saharan trade. Taroudan\'ts Jewish community numbered at about one thousand through the beginning of the 1950s, but eventually the majority of the population emigrated to other Moroccan cities, Paris, or Israel.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>"Agadir and the Anti-Atlas." <em>Jewish Morocco</em>.

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Raphy Elmaleh, Morocco\'s only Jewish tour guide, takes viewers on a special tour through the mellah (Jewish quarter) of the village of Ighil N\'Ogho, in the southern Moroccan region of Tallouine. Elmaleh shows the former home of the village\'s rabbi, who in an usual custom would keep the Torah scroll in his home rather than in the synagogue.</p></p>            <p><p>He introduces Zubeida, the haratine woman who today guards the town\'s synagogue, which Elmaleh helped restore. He also chats with Zubeida\'s brother, who worked on the restoration, and with an old man in the village who used to be the guardian of the mellah, making sure the Jewish quarter\'s gate was locked at night. The man identifies individuals in old photographs from the village (seen at the beginning of the video) and points out the homes and stores of Jews who left 50 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uJWdwERuIpk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Ighil N\'Ogho Mellah&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>At the center of the drama in the village&mdash;once home to over 300 Jews&mdash;is the geniza (burial ground for old religious texts) located beneath the synagogue. Muslim inhabitants of village recall that when the Jews left 50 years ago, they buried their books there and warned that no one should go inside; if anyone did they would be bitten by a scorpion and die. At the end of the video, Elmaleh reveals what happened the day he decided to risk his life to open the geniza. The result is a charming vignette that reflects the intricacies of Muslim-Jewish interaction in rural Morocco.</p></p>            <p><b>Sources:</b></br> <p>DiarnaInfo. "Ighil N\'Ogho Mellah."

        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>Enter the old mellah (Jewish quarter) of Rissani, a city in southeastern Morocco near the Algerian border, and explore its narrow alleyways in search of a famous home. Buried inside the mellah&rsquo;&rsquo;s labyrinth is the former home of the Baba Sali (Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira), an internationally renowned rabbi. Before he became an icon in Israel, France, and around the world, the Baba Sali lived on the edge of the Sahara desert in Morocco.</p></p>            <p><p>In 1912, his brother was murdered in Rissani, purportedly sacrificing his life to a local chieftan so that the rest of the Jewish community could survive. The Baba Sali continued to lead the large Jewish community of the Tafilalet region of southern Morocco, training most of the rabbis in the area. In 1950, he sold his home to a Muslim woman and left for Israel. After moving in, she recounts that the Baba Sali appeared to her in a dream and told her not to live in the house. She eventually vacated the home, which now sits empty, but opens it up so visitors can light candles by the well in the home&rsquo;&rsquo;s central courtyard.</p><p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0FC9qcaO6EE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Baba Sali Home in Rissani (Morocco)&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>This video begins with a walk into the mellah via the main gate, which for centuries was locked at night, enclosing the Jewish inhabitants.

      title: "Cemetery at Ifrane d'Anti-Atlas, Morocco",
      excerpt: 'cemetery',
      description:
        '            <p><b>Summary:</b> <p>At first glance, visitors see only a field of stones reminiscent of the surface of Mars. But this lonely cemetery, perched above a wadi and below a mountain at the edge of the Sahara desert, contains hundreds of graves. Out of the initial disorder, the shapes of tombs begin to emerge and bits of Hebrew writing poke out of the rubble. The ancient Jewish cemetery of Oufrane , 2,000 years old according to legend, memorializes thousands of Berber Jews, including a group of 50 who were burned alive over 200 years ago and whose ashes are buried in a cave alongside the cemetery. Until the Jewish community left en masse in 1958, visitors were barred from accessing parts of the cemetery without an official guide. Today the cemetery is open to all who climb the narrow path past Oufrane&rsquo;s Jewish quarter.</p></p>            <p><p><strong>Community:</strong> According to one tradition, Oufrane is named after Bene Efraim (sons of Efraim), who settled here in the wake of the first Temple in Jerusalem&rsquo;s destruction. At this important trading outpost along the caravan route carrying goods from southern Africa to northern ports, the community established the capital of what was once said to be a small independent Jewish kingdom. After the area was conquered by Muslim invaders in the 7th and 8th centuries, Jews lived under the personal protection of local rulers. Many ran successful businesses as merchants and artisans, but all remained at the mercy of their Muslim rulers.</p><p><strong>Persecution:</strong> In 1790, Sultran Mulay Yazid began a brief two-year reign of tyranny, persecuting Jewish communities across Morocco, including Oufrane. According to the community&rsquo;s oral tradition, a rebel named Bou Halatza arrived at the Thursday market joined by armed bandits and chained up 50 Jewish merchants. After torturing the men, Bou Halatza gave them a choice: convert to Islam or die in a bonfire erected in the middle of town.</p><p><strong><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6ymilsgv4Ig" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Jewish Cemetery in Ifrane</em></strong></p><p><strong>Martyrs&rsquo; Cave:</strong> The head of the community, Yehuda Ben-Nathan Effiat, decided to act as an example and rushed into the fire (his relatives later moved to London and became successful merchants). The remaining 49 merchants followed Effiat, jumping into the flames one by one. Later, the ashes of the 50 martyrs were gathered up by a group of Jews and Muslims and buried alongside the cemetery in a cave, which became an important pilgrimage site for Jews across the region.</p><p><strong>Guarded:</strong> For centuries, parts of the cemetery were off-limits to Jews, particularly an inner square. In this section were tombstones with inscriptions from 2,000 years ago, including the supposed gravestone of Eli from Galilee, a disciple of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai from the 1st century CE. Even up until the 1950s, visitors had to be guided to the cemetery by a community leader, often the local cantor, Avraham Ben-David.</p><p><strong>Status:&nbsp;</strong>Today, the cemetery has no guard. The &ldquo;cave of the burned,&rdquo; the cemetery, and a purification room are located one kilometer from the mellah (Jewish quarter). Wax from candles lit by Jewish pilgrims can sometimes be located along the trail to the cemetery. While almost all the tombs have decayed beyond recognition, some graves are discernable as a clump of rocks.
